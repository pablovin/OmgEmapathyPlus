1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
[S] So then where were we before we were rudely interrupted <breath>

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,520
[S] Ah.. right I moved to Sweden my friend had moved away kind of thing

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,280
[S] Um but when I did move to Sweden I started to get more into kind of

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,280
[S] <breath> I started really getting into music, I started listening to a lot of music

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,520
[S] And I also just felt that I really wanted to kind of be cool and play a musical instrument

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,460
[S] Or like at least do something with music like <laughs>

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,820
[S] So I kind of pestered my parents for it, but they didn't really like

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,260
[S] They treated it more as a kind of a flight of fancy, so they they didn't really care that I was interested in music

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,840
[S] Essentially like they just said yeah you do whatever <laughs> makes you feel happy

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,720
[S] They didn't want to shell out for a big like guitar or anything so <breath> that was unfortunate

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,720
[S] But er.. do you like music by the way?

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,400
[L] Depends on what kind of music yeah

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,420
[S] <laughs> That's.. a good answer <laughs> reasonable

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,460
[S] <breath> Ah yeah but eventually I did, after nagging them for a particularly long period of time

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,420
[S] I did eventually convince them that they would send me to a music oriented high school kind of <breath>

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:06,100
[S] As long as the high school had like kind of additional like maths and sciences, the necessary stuff, so you could do music on the side kind of an extra thing

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,920
[S] So I was very happy about that ah.. and once I got there I really liked it, it was like a really great school, I had great fun there, I learnt a lot

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,980
[S] Ah.. there was one such that I really hated and that was classical music theory and it was mostly because of the teacher

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,740
[S] And I'm pretty sure she was some kind of evil demon in the shape of a human being or something

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,580
[S] She was pretty awful as a human being, she was mean and judgmental and <breath> [L] Ah

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,880
[S] Almost a bit spiteful <laughs> I guess side effect of having to teach children all day <laughs>

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:45,180
[S] I suppose <laughs> but yeah I really liked it there but that one class really made my life hell essentially, I couldn't, I had trou

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,680
[L] I did meet some frieds and actually what really brought us together was how much we hated this particular teacher <laughs>

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,420
[S] Which is a bit weird when you think about it but um.. if it works I guess <laughs>

25
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,000
[S] Um.. yeah so the thing was that happened was kind of especially like everything was going fine for a while

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,780
[S] But eventually we had to give this kind of big presentation on classical music theory and <breath>

27
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,280
[S] I was really stressing out before this happened kind of, I was worried about partially giving the presentation

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,900
[S] Like I'm a bit of an introvert as per se, so like presenting is a bit of a thing in itself [L] Hmm

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,760
[S] But then you have to present to this kind of hellion of a teacher essentially um <laughs>

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,900
[S] And man I.. was scared of <laughs> scared of having to give that presentation ah..

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,720
[S] But I did, I really prepared I gave a presentation, I was nervous, I thought I'd done a really good job

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,880
[S] But wow she really.. cause everyone applauded and stuff, but then she just kind of

33
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,660
[S] Shredded my presentation, she said that this was wrong, you were so quiet about this, why didn't you do this better

34
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:49,760
[S] And I.. couldn't handle this kind of, I just kind of broke down, I went home to my parents crying

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,600
[S] Look I can't be here, I need to take this course but this one teacher like we can't deal with her essentially like she's too much

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,180
[S] So we talked to the school about it, and the school just told us like she's there to stay we can't get rid of her kind of

37
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:09,460
[S] She's there so you have to just kind of <breath> deal with <inaudible> so what we did do is we eventually arranged a transfer back over to like a normal high school

38
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,100
[S] Which shared a lot of courses with the musical school essentially, especially the technical subjects

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,560
[S] Um so then I could at least continue my schooling there so I could at least finish and graduate with a degree kind of

40
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,260
[S] So I did that and I finished and I eventually lost contact with these, with my friends I met there kind of

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,860
[S] What did happen though was later on when we well went to college kind of I eventually met up with these guys again

42
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,420
[S] Cause they'd also graduated as well from the school, finishing eventually, and they went to this one college <breath>

43
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,140
[S] And then we all met up and I was like <laughs> it was great to see them, I hadn't seen them again for so long

44
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,800
[S] And they'd also been playing in a band kind of so.. we were discussing and it's like

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,240
[S] Hey don't you want to join our band? I was like what? Like me? Yeah, it's like

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,920
[S] <inaudible> kind of said eh, I'd love to

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,340
[S] Ah.. so then we did practice and together as a group and then eventually we played a concert and then it was great, it was like

48
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,200
[S] I felt so liberated, it's so weird kind of <laughs> cause i'd always been very reclusive as we mentioned

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,280
[S] So like the chance to really perform and like.. wow it was amazing, so yeah

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:22,680
[S] And it was a great experience, so yeah.. I got in a band and I was a vocalist so <laughs> it was a pretty great experience
