00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
[L] Hi <inaudible>

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,340
[S] How was your weekend?

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,340
[L] Yeah, it was awesome. Cool stuff huh.

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,120
[S] Yeah..I went to Norway to visit a friend..ah..in Tromso

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,760
[S] you know? Have you ever been there? Norway? Sweden? Scandinavian?

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,040
[L] No.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,380
[S] Uh yeah. I went there. It was nice. You know it’s a bit cold in this period.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,760
[S] But, i mean, it is kind of always cold there, but, it was really here <inaudible> this guy..

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,020
[S] Um, so yeah Tromso is an interesting city. It’s kind of expensive, so..you know we just went out a couple of times to drink a beer, have dinner, but..

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,640
[S] <breath> you know it’s not the kind of life that you can afford as a student

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,040
[L] Huh.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:44,120
[S] Um, and then he you know had this thing with..he asked me if I had ever tried this..um..kind of..fish

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,380
[S] This really smelly fish which is supposed to be the smelliest food in the world. I think the name is something like Surstromming or something like that

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:59,780
[S] Herring, fermented with salt, which you know..it really smells disgusting, that’s what you say, but he told me that it actually tastes really good.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,600
[S] So we just made a bet like if we were able to you know eat this thing. Um and we went to supermarket. We got it, it’s like you know a tuna can. 

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:19,220
[S] But you’re not supposed to open that or eat that indoors because it really smells so you’re not encouraged to open that at home or whatever.

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:28,700
[S] So we have to go outdoors. It’s kind of small forest behind his place there and then we ah you know we just have to eat it. 

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,720
[S] The thing is I hate fish in general so it doesn’t have to be smelly to be disgusting for me.

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,000
[L] Huh.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,260
[S] You know, I kind of like salmon but not a lot. So..anyway I just didn’t want to lose the bet so we went for it. 

21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:50,700
[S] So we went for it and uh..these two cans..so the idea was that the guy finishing the..this thing..this fish first would win. 

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:02:00,100
[S] And I don’t like losing so okay I just do it. And as soon as we you know..actually open this can it was such this strong smell, the smell is really disgusting..

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:07,440
[S] I was..something strange I mean I tried this smelly tofu thing in China which was really, really weird. 

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,920
[S] But this was, man, such a strong fishy smell, something that could, really you know. <breath> So I was almost crying because of the smell

25
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,220
[S] But now the worst parts..the worst part that..was that now I have to eat you know <inaudible> <laughs>

26
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,040
[S] So, I also saw he was kind of really disgusted. So then I knew uh, man, you know this is not gonna taste good. 

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,540
[S] There is no way this gonna taste good, you know. But I, well, we went for it. So, three, two, one, bam!

28
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:40,780
[S] I really just you know took a piece, tried to put it in my mouth, but I mean I was crying so I really have to you know like this <action - covers his nose> my nose

29
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,520
[S] and I started eating it  and it was probably the most disgusting thing I ever tried in my life. 

30
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:54,780
[S] It’s not only smell, it was also the, the, the texture of the, you know, kind of this jello thing in your mouth and wow. 

31
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,980
[S] But, and also that guys was..but he was eating fast, maybe I don’t know maybe, he is used to it or maybe he like fish. 

32
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,060
[S] So then again I just you know closed my eyes, I went for it but I couldn’t finish it. 

33
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,360
[L] No?

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:14,560
[S] I..you know, at that point it’s like when you..when you’re eating and you just..<inaudible>I’m not..just..no way I can finish this it was really disgusting.

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,980
[S] But it’s a nice story I can tell. We also took some pictures of each other while you know enjoying this.

36
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,840
[L] Or crying

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,260
[S] Yeah, great dish from Norway

38
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,260
[L] Yeah, sounds cool.
