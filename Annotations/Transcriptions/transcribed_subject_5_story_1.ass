Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.60,0:02:58.75,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] uh.. and what we would do with this planks is that we would

Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.02,0:03:09.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] they wouldn't.. they wouldn't miss them it's just like some leftover planks so we took this leftover planks and like.. what we would do with this planks is that we would kinda build this a go kart essentially so we would nail this planks  
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.27,0:03:11.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] go kart?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.95,0:03:19.75,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] together like a kart wheel yeah it's so was like we would uh.. we build  this go kart over weekends kinda and then we'd put on some like we'd add an extra seat kind of and then we'd add a trunk in the back

Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.92,0:03:43.47,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] yeah I get that you still (like it?) <laughs> 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.92,0:03:47.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <laughs> (so mean?) uh.. well I mean just about 'cause the actually the thing with this thing was it was a bit dangerous
