1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
[S] Okay great where were we before we were interrupted um..

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,380
[S] Okay so <laughs> so after my friend had left

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,820
[S] For ages shortly after she had left I was a bit down in the dumps kind of

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,260
[S] I didn't really uh I just lost my close friend, I needed a kind of way to distract myself in some sense

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,760
[S] Er so I started to get a lot into music kind of

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,240
[S] Um.. do you like music? [L]  Yeah, I love music

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,160
[S] Oh very good, cause I really got into music kind of

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,000
[S] And I really wanted my parents to buy me an instrument kind of

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,940
[S] Like a guitar or something, so it kind of er..

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,500
[S] Kind of <laughs> get out, kind of get out of my system

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
[S] My parents viewed it more as a kind of phase essentially

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,900
[S] Just something I was going through, so they did kind of ignore me in some regard

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,280
[S] To a large extent kind of, they just thought it would pass

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,540
[S] But I just kept nagging them so it's like <laughs> it became a bit of a balance there

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:56,180
[S] The closest I can get was eventually I convinced them to send me to a music oriented high school kind of

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,480
[S] Once I graduated from middle school essentially

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,140
[S] So essentially they allowed me to go this kind of more, high school with a more emphasis on music

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,100
[S] If I could also go and attend normal, real classes there kind of <laughs>

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,800
[S] And not just these weird musical classes

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,660
[S] And that went great kind of, the school was very nice

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,460
[S] I had a lot of fun there, the food was good, a bit better than here <laughs> [L] <laughs> 

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,260
[S] Um so yeah no I really enjoyed going to school there

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,240
[S] But there was one thing I, one problem, one major problem I had with that school

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,780
[S] There was this one mandatory course called er classical music theory [L] Uh-huh

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,980
[S] And.. the problem with this course was I really..

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,060
[S] I'm pretty sure the teacher was a kind of demon in the shape of a human kind of thing [L] <laughs>

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,620
[S] She was pretty awful, she used to really yell at students

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,840
[S] And belittle them, and like drag students around by the ear and stuff, it was pretty bad [L] Hmm

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,020
[S] I.. I really did not like this teacher <laughs> she was pretty awful

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,040
[S] Ah the good thing was that I actually met a couple people like me

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,300
[S] And some of those students took her class, and I essentially bonded with these four guys kind of

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,520
[S] Over just hating this particular teacher because she was just an awful human being kind of <laughs>

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,680
[S] Ah which was interesting <laughs>

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,040
[S] But yeah and that continued on for about a year, I went to this school kind of, I really enjoyed myself

35
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,600
[S] After one year essentially we had to give this presentation on classical music theory

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,720
[S] In front of the entire class, and I was very nervous about this because I was still very shy

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,940
[S] And shy kind of as a person at that point in time [L] Uh-huh

38
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,440
[S] So partially just having to present in front of the entire class was a problem

39
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,360
[S] And then the fact that I had to present in front of this teacher which I was just terrified of essentially

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,880
[S] Cause she was just evil <laughs> um..

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,360
[S] So I did spend a lot of time like practicing and preparing for this

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,060
[S] And I rehearsed and I kind of, well I felt fairly confident [L] Uh-huh

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,360
[S] So I went up and I gave the presentation

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,380
[S] And people laughed and they applauded when I was done, I thought I'd done a really good job

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,020
[S] Um but once I was done, the teacher really like laid into my presentation

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,860
[S] Like no this wrong, why did you say this, you can't mean this, why did you do this

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,800
[S] Can you just speak louder? It's like.. and I was really like distraught after this kind of

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,000
[S] Cause I was a very fragile person, so I actually had to go like, I basically cried essentially

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,220
[S] And I went back home and I told my parents I can't deal with this kind of, this is too much for me um..

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,900
[S] So we had to go and with the school kind of, see if we could do anything about it

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,820
[S] But like the school said that basically she's on a bunch of boards, we can't get rid of her, so she's basically there to stay

52
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,860
[S] Ah and I couldn't just deal with her anymore like because it was a mandatory course

53
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,420
[S] Sure but like, couldn't handle her for another two years er.. [L] Uh-huh

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,920
[S] So eventually we discussed and like we decided to send me to like

55
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,220
[S] This musical high school shared a lot of courses with the normal high school essentially

56
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,840
[S] So I could transfer over to the normal without like impacting my studies too much

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,900
[S] And my parents were also happy I was back to a more technical subject as well <laughs> [L] <laughs>

58
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,640
[S] So I, yeah I eventually went to the normal high school and finished my curriculum there

59
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,860
[S] It was a shame I couldn't finish at the musical school but you know <laughs> life [L] Yeah

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,540
[S] Um.. I did actually meet up with one of the guys that went to the musical school when I went to college

61
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,620
[S] So I went to college, I met up with, I found <inaudible> in the corridor, said hey how are you doing?

62
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,260
[S] And we talked a bit and it's ah no we're still playing in this band kind of er..

63
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,860
[S] With the other four guys I'd met earlier on

64
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,740
[S] And then he said like ah you should join us some time, it would be fun. I was like me? <laughs> [L] <laughs>

65
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,340
[S] It's like yeah, yeah, I remember you're good at singing. Like really? Oh, okay

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,560
[S] So I actually did sing for them as vocalist

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,020
[S] I did sing and we played and we practiced a bit kind of

68
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,260
[S] And eventually we arranged to have a bit of a like concert for um.. some of our friends and

69
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,600
[S] Close friends and stuff and it's like that was a really good experience

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,320
[S] Cause like when we had that concert, I really felt like I was alive kind of, I really felt like I was on cloud nine, it was a great experience [L] Uh-huh

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,540
[S] Er.. so that was yeah so

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,940
[S] That's how I got to sing in a band and still keep in touch with them
