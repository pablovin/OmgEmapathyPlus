Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.12,0:00:51.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This really smelly fish which is supposed to be the smelliest food in the world. I think the name is something like Surstromming or something like that
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.38,0:00:59.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Herring, fermented with salt, which you know..it really smells disgusting, that’s what you say, but he told me that it actually tastes really good.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.82,0:01:09.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we just made a bet like if we were able to you know eat this thing. Um and we went to supermarket. We got it, it’s like you know a tuna can. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.60,0:01:19.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But you’re not supposed to open that or eat that indoors because it really smells so you’re not encouraged to open that at home or whatever.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.22,0:01:28.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we have to go outdoors. It’s kind of small forest behind his place there and then we ah you know we just have to eat it. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.70,0:01:33.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The thing is I hate fish in general so it doesn’t have to be smelly to be disgusting for me.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.00,0:01:41.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You know, I kind of like salmon but not a lot. So..anyway I just didn’t want to lose the bet so we went for it. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.26,0:01:50.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we went for it and uh..these two cans..so the idea was that the guy finishing the..this thing..this fish first would win.
