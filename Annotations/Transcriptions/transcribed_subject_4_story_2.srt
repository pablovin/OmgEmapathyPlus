1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
[S] So where were we before we were interrupted er..

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,220
[S] Okay so I told you about my friend and she had moved essentially um..

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,320
[S] Shortly after she had moved

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,620
[S] And I actually.. I haven't told you about this, I'm actually the vocalist in a band

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,800
[S] Did you know that?

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,340
[L] No.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,040
[S] <laughs> Interesting fact um.. there's actually a story behing that because

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,020
[S] Er shortly after she had moved, I started to get a lot more into music, kind of

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,120
[S] So I got a lot more into like <breath>

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,700
[S] I kept listening to all of these kind of nerdy videos

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,700
[S] About like people playing guitars and kind of showing you how to do different chords and stuff um

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,640
[S] So I got really interested in that kind of and I started to like tell my parents look I wanna play an instrument, buy me an instrument kind of

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,100
[S] Ah they didn't take it too seriously kind of

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,220
[S] They just kind of take it as um.. kind of a passing flight of fancy for me essentially <laughs>

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,000
[S] So they didn't really agree to buy me anything too exciting <laughs>

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,800
[S] Um the best I could do is kind of when I was transferring into essentially high school

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,820
[S] Is like convince them to send me to a kind of a special like half music kind of specialty high school

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,460
[S] As long as they had all the other like subjects there, they had the maths and they had the chemistry and they had the stuff

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,160
[S] So it was like, I could go there as long as I did some real subjects you know, on the side <laughs> [L] Yeah, yeah

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,480
[S] Um.. so yeah, so basically I went there

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,680
[S] And I, when I started there it was really great, like I learned a lot kind of

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040
[S] School was great, it was really nice campus, really nice atmosphere essentially [L] Uh-huh

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,440
[S] Aside from the <inaudible> in here <laughs> [L] That sucks

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,240
[S] But er yeah so.. yeah I really enjoyed it there

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,220
[S] And the only thing a had one problem with was this one mandatory class called classical music theory

26
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,920
[S] And I really hated that class, and I really hated that class cause I really hated the teacher in that class

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,200
[S] I'm pretty sure she was some kind of a demon in the skin of a human you know, it was pretty bad <laughs>

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,420
[S] Um so I really, cause she was really just a mean and cruel person

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,040
[S] Like she used to drag kids around by the ears kind of, almost a bit pseudo-abusive, not great um

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,520
[S] So I really hated that class kind of, it was very boring

31
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,100
[S] I actually met some friends who like, at that school, <inaudible> friends

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,440
[S] That we bonded over essentially just hating this one teacher kind of, it was <laughs>

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,600
[S] Um yeah so it was pretty <laughs> pretty dramatic to do that but we, I learned a lot and I had a great, some great fun there

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,560
[S] Um.. that continued well for a while kind of, until a couple of months

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,480
[S] So a couple of, it was two, one year down the line or something

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,180
[S] Like we were suppose give this presentation in front of the entire class on like classical music theory with this harpy of a teacher right

37
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,720
[S] Um <laughs> so I started to, I was very nervous for, before this presentation

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,320
[S] Because like I had to, first I had to go up and present it in front of everyone, I was still a bit introverted

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,220
[S] This time has kind of subsided, I don't know if you noticed <laughs> [L] I did

40
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,040
[S] But um I was partially scared cause I had to give the presentation in front of everyone

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,320
[S] And partially because I had to do it in front of this teacher who I was terrified of essentially

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,080
[S] So I studied very hard for this, and I made a very good presentation, what I thought was a very good presentation

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,300
[S] And I eventually went up and gave the presentation in front of the class, I thought I'd done very well

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,600
[S] But then I started to get feedback from this teacher like, no this is ridiculous, you should've done this, this wasn't good enough, this was awful like

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,340
[S] So I really <laughs> ah that was really heavy for me

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,240
[S] I really inflicted a blow on my self esteem kind of

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,400
[S] So I like went back to my parents in shambles and I cried and like <breath> [L] Ah

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,240
[S] I told them basically look we couldn't, I couldn't like keep going and being at the school and having to deal with this teacher kind of

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,080
[S] Cause I had to have her for another two years or something, it was ridiculous [L] Hmm

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,140
[S] We talked with the school about this teacher before, they said that look she's basically there to stay, we can't do anything about it

51
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,380
[S] So like uh it was pretty bad

52
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,620
[S] So what we did arrange eventually is that I could actually transfer back to the normal high school kind of

53
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,240
[S] Where they had, because they shared a lot of courses with this music school [L] Uh-huh

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,260
[S] So I could kind of complete the rest of my education at this normal high school kind of, so I <breath> [L] Yeah

55
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,300
[S] Transferred over there, which was a shame kind of, cause I did enjoy being at this kind of special music school

56
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,660
[S] Cause I had to have her like several times a week and she was awful kind of, so yeah [L] <inaudible> yeah

57
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,120
[S] So I did eventually keep going to this high school and I graduated in all the stuff, kind of the most technical subjects

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,540
[S] Ah eventually when I went to college essentially

59
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,980
[S] I actually met up with these four guys from, that I'd met from high school

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
[S] From this kind of musical high school kind of

61
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,560
[S] Ah and I was chatting with them kind of and we were catching up on old times er

62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,580
[S] And then one of them said hey we're still playing kind of, you should join us. I was like wow me? <laughs>

63
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,820
[S] Yeah you used to be pretty good at singing. I was like uh I mean okay <laughs>

64
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,380
[S] Ah so we tried out a bit and we practiced a bit and it was really fun er

65
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,020
[S] Actually a couple of months after I met them we then we actually had a concert kind of

66
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,000
[S] I felt really grat during that concert it was amazing kind of <laughs> [L] Uh-huh nice

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,280
[S] I felt really like liberated to be able to do this kind of

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,760
[S] It was really a nice experience for me to just kind of, to let go and kind of really express myself so [L] Ah great

69
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,860
[S] Yeah, yeah so I keep in touch with them and

70
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,600
[S] We jam out from time to time <laugh>

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,240
[L] I see, that's good [S] Yeah, yeah that's how I did that so

72
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,140
[S] Now you know <laughs> [L] Good
