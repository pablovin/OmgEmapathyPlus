1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
[L] <inaudible> you doing good? [S] Yeah, yeah um

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,180
[S] Uh I was traveling over the weekend it was really annoying. Uh do you like traveling?

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,120
[L] Yeah [S] Do you like air travel? [L] Yeah

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,600
[S] Um well air travel for me is like really annoying and er really scary ah and

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,720
[S] It's always like this thing where you are in the mid of air and there's

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,680
[S] Literally something goes wrong there's literally no chance for your survival right?

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,020
[S] And um over the weekend, on Friday evening actually, I was traveling to Brussels

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,200
[S] I found this cheap flight so I took it

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,540
[S] Only for that day they had a special flight with some special offer

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,180
[S] And I went to the er, it was in the night so it was like the last flight of the day

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,200
[S] You know in Europe how they close airports for the night and there's no night flights per se [L] Uh-huh

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,240
[S] So this is the last, I think the last flight of the day or something

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,720
[S] Yeah, I reached the airport two hours early um

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,400
[S] Just.. because I knew it might be delayed or something

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,080
[S] Ah it was a windy, stormy night, it was rain happening like <inaudible>

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,160
[S] And as soon as I reach the airport, I see this like huge cue of people for check in

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,960
[S] Because apparantly all the flights below, uh before that were delayed

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
[S] Um because of the weather and there was this huge cue and

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,360
[S] Even with the two hours that I had before the boarding actually started

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,440
[S] I still just barely managed to get to board the plane

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,260
[S] Because I was, the whole check in cue I had this big bag, I shouldn't have carried a big bag, which I had to check in

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,820
[S] After this long cue of check in

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,080
[S] This, again this long cue of security

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,840
[S] It took me like almost two hours to finish all of that

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,800
[S] And I just barely managed the boarding

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,720
[S] And they were like closing the boarding when I actually reached it

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,680
[S] You know how in some airports or in some place, they don't have the bridge to the plane

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,200
[S] And you have to get down and take the bus, and the bus goes. I hate that, I hate going to the bus.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,420
[S] Just so annoying, on the <inaudible> going with the bus yeah [L] Uh-huh

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,020
[S] And um.. so we board the bus, and with the bus we reach the plane

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,100
[S] And, and what I see is a really small plane

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,040
[S] You know one of those propeller planes, like 60, 70-seater planes

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,460
[S] And I hate those propeller planes, I feel really insecure flying in those propeller planes

34
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,760
[S] I like jets a lot, because well you have better chance of survival for the weather, right?

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,720
[S] Propellers are just so annoying. Strong wind and the propeller stops, it's just annoying.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,580
[S] So better than I thought it was, they kind of, they were getting late because of the delays before

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,260
[S] So they just pushed us in literally, they just hurried us to our seats

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,300
[S] And said you should <inaudible> as soon as possible like

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,080
[S] Not even giving us our time to you know settle down

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,400
[S] Just forcing us to get in, it was a bit rude as well

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,280
[S] Um to be sat down in the plane, and um..

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,960
[S] Then there was announcement saying that well the air traffic control won't let us fly because of the weather

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
[S] So we were waiting for a clearance 

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,760
[L] I see. [S] And I was like why, why the hell were you just pushing us in in the first place if this was the case?

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,800
[S] Can you imagine we spent one hour on the tarmac waiting for clearance to fly [L] <inaudible>

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,440
[S] Just sitting there, and they don't even switch on the air conditioning, it's

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,880
[S] You can't breathe after some point of time, there's I mean it's not like you can open a window or something

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,100
[S] It's nothing, and it's a cramped, small plane

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,060
It's just so annoying um..

50
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,440
[S] Then after an hour or something, they actually er.. we actually went to the er.. were allowed to take off

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,620
[S] The take off happened, it was not the best of the take off, you know

52
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,640
[S] Pretty wavering  and uh it was okay

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,840
[S] Um we reached to some cruising height and then suddenly um

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,000
[S] There's announcement that well you should not take off your seat belt 

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,820
[S] Because there's turbulence and bla bla and

56
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,480
[S] The lavatories were not allowed to be used, we can't go to the lavatories

57
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
[S] And we had to just sit in this place because the plane was going from left to right because of the er turbulence

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,240
[S] Um.. then at one point of time, suddenly I felt like this plane was falling

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,880
[S] Like having a free fall, you know how in turbulence sometimes it falls down?

60
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,480
[S] And it, it's not like a small one, it just fell down for like 300, 400 feet I believe and

61
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,700
[S] And suddenly the lights went off, off the plane and

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,380
[S] It was just free falling, there was lightning outside

63
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,640
[S] Through the seat, these flashes of light coming in, it was just really from a horror movie or something, it's really scary

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,360
[S] And then all of the sudden these oxygen masks drop off

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,700
[S] And we're asked to put them on, and I've never experienced this before in my life

66
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,040
[S] These oxygen masks coming down, so I'm just, I was not able to do it

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,580
[S] Uh so the guy next to me was able to help me

68
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,120
[S] And I was put the oxygen mask, and I could breathe again

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,540
[S] But I could still feel like it was trying to climb up and then fall, climb up and fall, it went on for some time, I felt really sick

70
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,340
[S] Um and scared at the same time, I thought that this is the end, I'm gonna die

71
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,080
[S] And then um it went on for like 10, 15 minutes

72
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,180
[S] Of this terrible um turbulence, and then eventually it kind of smoothed out

73
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,080
[S] Probably climbed up to a good altitude, and we were asked to remove the masks, and the lights came on again

74
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,860
[S] But it was like this harrowing and uh scary experience I had um

75
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,980
[S] I'm already scared about the air travel and the propeller planes

76
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,940
[S] And this was like my worst nightmare coming to life

77
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,940
[S] Um and then we were about to reach the destination and then even the landing was bumpy

78
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,200
[S] We just jumped twice on, on the, on the runway 

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,540
[S] Um it was such a scary, annoying experience of my life

80
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,900
[S] That I'm scared to travel using airlines again

81
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,100
[S] On my way back, I canceled my flight, I took a train

82
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,340
[S] It took me long but fine at least I knew I was, I was safer than that

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,340
[S] There was no, no gush of air would make me die <laughs>

84
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,060
[S] Or something, it was just uh, and I'm scared to take the plane anymore

85
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,820
[S] I'm pretty sure I'm gonna check if it's a jet plane or a propeller plane

86
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,340
[S] How many people, never gonna take the night flights out

87
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,720
[S] Uh it was just so scary, so, so scary for me

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
[L] Um it must be very terrible to have that experience

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
[S] It was just
