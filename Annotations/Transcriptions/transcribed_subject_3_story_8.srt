[S] actually so smelly that they discourage to to eat that indoors

45
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,370

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,100
[S] and they would made a bet

57
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,100
[S] and we should eat one

58
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,050
[S] and you know, the one who eats faster wins

59
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,770
[S] was kind of simbolic bet so there was not a lot of money involved

60
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,050

93
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,880
[S] it's not true it's gonna taste good so, you know, i lost

94
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,160
[S] my hope but anyway

95
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,500
[S] so yeah now I have to try it

96
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,270
[S] were there, it took me like five minutes to

97
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,020
[S] psychologically prepare

98
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,350
[S] to taste that 'cause

99
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,570
[S] it smelled (terrible?), it looked (terrible?)

100
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,900

[S] so yeah so

103
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,050
[S] actually I don't even like fish in general so that was

104
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,570
[S] to my disadvantage 'cause I think

105
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,570
[S] maybe if you like tuna or

106
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,200
[S] raw fish but wow

107
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,670
[S] I was overwhelmed by this but

108
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,800
[S] you know it was (kinda?) experience

109
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
