1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
[S] Hey, how are you?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,600
[L] <inaudible> I'm fine, how about you? [S] Yeah? Good, good, good, good.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,400
[S] I was remembering some stuff this weekend

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,740
[S] You.. how was your high school time? Was it good?

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,900
[L] Yeah, I <inaudible> really good, yeah [S] Yeah, you like it?

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,580
[L] Yeah [S] Yeah, ah I've met lot of people and..

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,260
[S] I mean it's really half part, some people really like it, some people really, really hate it

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,940
[S] I didn't like much, it was really a hard time

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,420
[S] I was moving from cities and then I.. [L] Uh-huh

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,240
[S] Started on second year of high school in a new school

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,840
[S] And I think that makes everything worse, right? I mean

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,040
[S] I guess arriving at school, you don't know anyone, or anyone knows you [L] Hmm

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,680
[S] And you're kind of flung the kind of apart

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,200
[S] Disconnected from everything else, right?

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,520
[S] And on top of that I was a very bad student

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,820
[S] So I was, yeah.. I was never, I never liked to study

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,200
[S] The, the courses they had at high school was always boring [L] Yeah

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,440
[S] And I did everything just to, enough to pass [L] Pass

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,740
[S] Yeah, never liked to learn or something like that

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,280
[S] But this changed when a, a new teacher arrived in the school

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,580
[S] And it was a.. history teacher, right? He was a nice guy.. [L] Hmm

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,700
[S] He was very young.. uh different from the, from the teachers from the school

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,040
[S] They were, the other teachers, they were very old

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,340
[S] You know this very old very um..

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,340
[S] Aggressive type, this, yeah, authority type, you know?

26
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,900
[S] And that becomes also a very bad thing

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,740
[S] How to, a bad way to connect with them, and then to, to, to

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,380
[S] There was <inaudible> personal (days?) of the subject, right?

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,920
[S] But yeah this guy arrived, and he was new, he was very young

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,540
[S] Uh he was very cool, very light

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,560
[S] And.. he kind of taught differently

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,460
[S] He had a better didactic than the other teachers at some point

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,700
[S] Um.. yeah and I start to pay a bit of attention on his lecture

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,720
[S] But not enough because I fail the first.. test

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,060
[S] And.. it was like, yeah, wow, that's not good.

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,900
[S] But then he came talk to me after the first test and..

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,740
[S] Yeah, he say yeah why you fail? Let's see what's happening

38
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,760
[S] You pay attention a lot on the lectures, you're there always, so

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,160
[S] And the we talked a lot, and, and he helped me a lot on, on, uh uh uh, yeah

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,860
[S] Learning how to get used to, to the lecture

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,980
[S] And to get used to study, you know? To, to pass, you know?

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,280
[S] And.. yeah, then came the second test

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
[S] The second evaluation, I fail again

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,880
[L] Uh.. [S] Yeah, again, and I was feeling bad

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,420
[S] Really feeling let down, really like, wow, yeah, that's not.. helpful

46
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,420
[S] And then he came talk to me again and then I felt even worse

47
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,700
[S] Because we've talked before, you know? And it was like wow, wow, that's bad

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,380
[S] And then I study, study, study, uh..

49
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,880
[S] And I was in a pressure, because it was the final exam

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,840
[S] And I should pass the final exam, otherwise I would fail the, the, the class

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,580
[S] Uh.. and I pressure myself to study a lot.. a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,200
[S] But I panicked the night before the exam

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,060
[S] I was really like wow I cannot fail this, I will feel bad

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,100
[S] Then everything would be going away. I mean, it's awful to fail, right?

55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,200
[S] And.. then I decided to make some, some strips of paper

56
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,100
[S] And put the, the names and dates of the things happening

57
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,300
[S] And then put on my sleeve <breath>

58
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,720
[S] Really not proud of that, it was really bad to do it, you know?

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,220
[S] But yeah I was desperate, I was really panicking

60
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,020
[S] And I did the test, I used the, the, the cheats on the test and um..

61
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,720
[S] I felt so bad when I hand in the test

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,980
[S] I felt so disgusted with myself

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,620
[S] I mean wow, how can I, I break the trust of this guy that really trusted on me, yeah, I..

64
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,180
[S] I did something so bad to me, to myself

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,140
[S] I mean I cheated myself, not the exam, right?

66
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,940
[S] And.. in the end I pass the test, I pass the exam..

67
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,400
[S] Uh but.. I never did this anymore, I was really

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,920
[S] It was really a strong milestone in my life, really like, wow that was really bad

69
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,940
[S] Really, really, really strong uh.. really, really, really bad feeling

70
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,440
[L] Yeah, that must <inaudible> really difficult situation <inaudible> [S] Yeah
