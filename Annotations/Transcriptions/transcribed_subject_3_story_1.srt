1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,300

[S] ok, had a good week so far?

4
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,770
[L] yeah, was.. I think so

5
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,100
[S] yeah that's how I feel as well

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,070
[S] ok so I'm gonna tell you a bit about my childhood today kinds of stuff and two stories about my childhood

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,220
[S] um.. first off would say that you're an introvert ?

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,120
[L] sorry what?

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,420
[S] introvert.. kind of you're a bit shy or a bit uh.. kind of you'd like to keep yourself kind of thing you get tired from being around people

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,020
[L] that depends on the people that are around me sometimes I am

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,870
[S] <inaudible> <laughs> uh yeah but I was very introverted and like very reclusive as a kid kinda I enjoyed being on my own a lot and I kind of

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,770
[L] <laughs>
[S] <inaudible> <laughs> uh yeah but I was very introverted and like very reclusive as a kid kinda I enjoyed being on my own a lot and I kind of

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:37,820
[S] <inaudible> <laughs> uh yeah but I was very introverted and like very reclusive as a kid kinda I enjoyed being on my own a lot and I kind of

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:46,720
[S] I don't know it was a bit lonely but I didn't mind kinda it was nice.. it was peaceful for me kind of a.. and that continued through most of my childhood

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:55,650
[S] so.. that thing changed when I eventually moved to Sweden which I did around the age of.. was it eleven? eleven.. twelve I think I moved to Sweden kind of

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:04,250
[S] and that <inaudible> scary experience right? I was a bit lonely at first but I (did?) meet people <inaudible> starting this new school so I (had?) to meet people there

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:14,050
[S] started a new class uh.. and then I met this one person I spent a lot of time (with?) this girl and she was really nice she was amazing she was really outgoing kinda 

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:23,775
[S] she was very independent which I really admired 'cause I was just so shy and reclusive from where I was originally um.. and we spent a lot of time together we watched a lot of

19
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:33,650
[S] cartoons and we played a lot of video games together and yeah we had great fun and I really enjoyed spending time with her and we got to a lot of mischief and kind of weird

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:42,350
[S] stuff so there was actually this one thing that we build uh.. we had this like lumbered mill do you know where they make like planks a whole bunch of planks and they use this for furniture 

21
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,750
[L] uh-huh
[S] stuff so there was actually this one thing that we build uh.. we had this like lumbered mill do you know where they make like planks a whole bunch of planks and they use this for furniture 

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,400
[S] stuff so there was actually this one thing that we build uh.. we had this like lumbered mill do you know where they make like planks a whole bunch of planks and they use this for furniture 

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:52,850
[S] where they store the planks we had this kind of thing close to us and me and her used to sneak in and kind of steal like small planks and (after?) the planks from there and what we'd do with these

24
00:01:52,850 --> 00:02:02,950
[S] planks is that we'd kind of (hammering?) these planks to get it to the shape of like a (go?) kart essentially we'd put some wheels on it and her and me would keep like building up this kart overtime so we put in this

25
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:12,825
[S] seat we'd put in like a <inaudible> work so we'd put in like small (spoils?) at the back of it trying to make it go faster or something I don't know we were kids we were not the smartest 

26
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:23,350
[S] and what we'd do with this (go?) kart is her and me we would bring it to the top of a hill and we'd kid of sit in it and kind of roll down kind of this hill and it was like this paved uh.. road kinda 

27
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:31,900
[S] paved road hill next to my house essentially right? and as you can imagine this probably wasn't.. wasn't the smartest of ideas right?

28
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,475
[S] <laughs> so rickety wooden thing going down of a hill at a certain speed with squishy humans in it is not a.. great <laughs> great idea um.. so I did actually get very 

29
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:33,025
[L] yeah
[S] <laughs> so rickety wooden thing going down of a hill at a certain speed with squishy humans in it is not a.. great <laughs> great idea um.. so I did actually get very 

30
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:42,350
[S] <laughs> so rickety wooden thing going down of a hill at a certain speed with squishy humans in it is not a.. great <laughs> great idea um.. so I did actually get very 

31
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:52,725
[S] hurt doing this at some point in time like.. 'cause what happened is we rolled this thing to the top of the hill I sat in it and normally we would just let going down kind of a (path?) speed but what happened this time was she really

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,300
[S] like I was (in?) and then she pretty pushed it like really hard so then I started to go down with speed I'm like hanging on and the thing is bobbling what happened is the thing eventually curved and flipped over kinda 

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:12,750
[S] and I was stuck in it still so it's like my top half was out and bottom was still stuck in the thing kinda so I couldn't get out so what happened was I kinda like landed on my side and I scraped

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,375
[S] down the side of my arm and it got very bloody really bad yeah <laughs> it it wasn't great it wasn't great let me tell you it was really painful and like 

35
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:19,225
[L] hm.. uh.. <inaudible>
[S] down the side of my arm and it got very bloody really bad yeah <laughs> it it wasn't great it wasn't great let me tell you it was really painful and like 

36
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:22,325
[S] down the side of my arm and it got very bloody really bad yeah <laughs> it it wasn't great it wasn't great let me tell you it was really painful and like 

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:32,075
[S] so she screamed and there was blood everywhere and she had to run off and get my dad because I was just a bloody mess on the ground kind of so like <laughs> uh.. yeah that took me a while to 

38
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:40,675
[S] recover from it was not a great idea I think it's a good experience kinda, it's the kind of stuff that you remember like when you get older kinda, all the stupid things you do as kid

39
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,650
[S] would you say you did stupid stuff as a kid as well?

40
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,575
[L] I've done some but.. uh.. (not a one?) I think I recall but I'm sure there is a lot 

41
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:44,950
[S] <laughs>
[L] I've done some but.. uh.. (not a one?) I think I recall but I'm sure there is a lot 

42
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,225
[L] I've done some but.. uh.. (not a one?) I think I recall but I'm sure there is a lot 

43
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:47,675
[S] <laughs>
[L] I've done some but.. uh.. (not a one?) I think I recall but I'm sure there is a lot 

44
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,125
[L] I've done some but.. uh.. (not a one?) I think I recall but I'm sure there is a lot 

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:58,775
[S] yeah yeah 'cause that's part of (us?) being.. it's.. being kids is about making mistakes and learning from them don't matter how stupid they'd be kinda yeah but I had fun really a lot of fun with this girl in my youth 

46
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:08,275
[S] kind of a.. so but the thing as time went on I got to learn that she was eventually moving away so I'd known her for like couple of months now and she was my

47
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:17,925
[S] first real friend in Sweden kinda <inaudible> spoke English to me it was amazing I didn't know any Swedish <inaudible> time uh.. but I got to know she was moving away I was actually

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:26,725
[S] her family was moving to Asia kinda 'cause her dad had gotten a job there um.. so basically she told me that and I was very upset and 

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,550
[S] like I was worried about being alone 'cause she was my only real friend it's like.. it wasn't.. it was difficult um..

50
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:42,975
[S] so we agreed to exchange each others phone numbers kind of 'cause this was in a time before Facebook, (Instagram?) and stuff like that... <laughs> which 

51
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:53,150
[S] yeah so we exchange phone numbers and <inaudible> but it didn't really work kind of for whatever reason we couldn't get in touch with each others nothing worked kind of so yeah was a bit 

52
00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:02,000
[S] unfortunate I lost contact with her for a couple of years and I was very sad in the beginning I got over it eventually but it wasn't great for me for a long time 

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,350
[S] uh.. eventually she did come back to contact with me like I think it was five years later or something like Facebook suddenly like a message like uh.. how you doing you remember me 

54
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:22,150
[S] I was like yeah it was like wow <inaudible> she's back uh.. so we talked a bit kind of and we uh.. kind started to share.. to talk a bit about our past

55
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:31,400
[S] so we talked about the stuff we did uh.. and we talked quite a lot about nostalgic things but like as we talked like a realized she was getting less and less interested like she would have shorter and shorter responses 

56
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:40,650
[S] kind of it'd take longer and longer to get a response like I was enthusiastic but she was obviously.. had  changed her thoughts since she moved uh.. so eventually as

57
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,700
[S] time went on we kind of lost contact which is sad like (how?) people grow up <laughs> and change 

58
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,525
[L] yeah yeah..
[S] time went on we kind of lost contact which is sad like (how?) people grow up <laughs> and change 

59
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:47,750
[S] time went on we kind of lost contact which is sad like (how?) people grow up <laughs> and change 

60
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:54,075
[S] and uh.. yeah so overtime we just stopped talking and I haven't really heard of her since hm..

61
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,850
[S] it's a sad story at the end?

62
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,125
[L] yeah it's a bit sad <laughs> sorry <laughs>

65
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,100

66
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
[S] people change right?
