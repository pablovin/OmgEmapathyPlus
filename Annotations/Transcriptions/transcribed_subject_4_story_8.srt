[S] smelly food they had this kind of 

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,400
[S] um fermented fish 

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,775
[S] with salt you know it's supposed to be the smelliest food in the world

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,800
[S] have you ever heard that 

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,250

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,925
[S] um doesn't matter what you say smells bad but it tastes great

24
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,920
[S] and I was like really does it taste great ?

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,920
[S] so yeah why don't we try it 

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,975
[S] and I was a little kind of skeptical about it 'cause once I had the smelly tofu in Beijing 

27
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,600
[S] and it was honestly the most disgusting experience 

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,175
[S] <inaudible>

29
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:13,170
[S] of you know this mix of that smell

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,975
[S] that taste but on the other hand I mean I was like yeah let's just do it 

31
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,825
[S] and you know we made a bet 

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,800
[S] so like we had to finish it 

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,075
[S] I was like ok um so we went to supermarket we got it was kind of this you know kind of tuna cans

34
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,825
[S] which had this thing already the can looked kinda disgusting and oh my god 

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,500
[S] um you're not supposed to eat this 

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,550
[S] you know indoors so inside your home 'cause this kind of smell forever so we had to go 

37
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,625
[L] hmm
[S] you know indoors so inside your home 'cause this kind of smell forever so we had to go 

38
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,375
[S] you know indoors so inside your home 'cause this kind of smell forever so we had to go 

39
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:48,375
[S] somewhere else so we went to this small park close to his place 

40
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:54,075
[S] um.. it was cold so you know for the smell that's good 'cause you know 

41
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,625
[S] when it's really really cold the smell doesn't sting so hard but anyway so we went there 

42
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,620
[S] um..

43
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,675
[S] and yeah so the thing is I don't like fish in general 

44
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:04,725
[L] uh-huh

45
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,425
[S] and then I also the smelly one so I really had a lot of 
[L] uh-huh

46
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,300
[S] and then I also the smelly one so I really had a lot of 

47
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,225
[S] I needed a lot of psychological preparation so ok I'm about to eat this kinda

48
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,220
[S] raw smelly fish

49
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,375
[S] that I know will smell a lot but anyway I just did it 

50
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,225
[S] and as soon as I opened this can I was like wow it's really

51
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,275
[S] was not only the smell also the look you know when you saw 

52
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,200
[S] when I saw that fish with that oil there was like oh my god 

53
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,125
[S] and I saw his face and his face was so disgusted as well so I knew that it would not 

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,950
[S] taste good at all so he was lying to me of course I kind of knew it from the beginning 

55
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,225
[S] but yeah but I wanted to win the bet um..

56
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,000
[S] so you know was the 

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
[S] moment of truth in which I had to really 

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,100
[S] take that gluey thing 

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,650
[S] out of the can and put it in my mouth 

60
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,000

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,650
[S] and I mean I did the first try but I couldn't was kind of ok stop and then I looked at my friend and he was like literally crying
