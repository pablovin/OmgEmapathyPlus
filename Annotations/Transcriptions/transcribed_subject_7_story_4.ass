Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.33,0:00:30.73,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was looking a train and it takes a lot o time to go by train so..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.73,0:00:33.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I thought I might take a fly that's normally expensive
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.42,0:00:35.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.77,0:00:36.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.80,0:00:38.11,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] At the website I found this really cheap flight
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.11,0:00:39.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That I could use
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.48,0:00:46.57,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I took that one, and I booked that flight and I went to the airport, I was taking it at the end of the evening this kinda of flight is almost the last one of the day
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.55,0:00:53.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So when I reached the airport, was a bit rainy and a bit windy, so I thought that it might be delayed <inaudible> early..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.84,0:00:55.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Took a lot of hours, actually
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.84,0:00:59.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And at last there was a huge huge queue for check-in
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.66,0:01:05.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Apparently, Uh, all the flights before ours were delayed because weather
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.26,0:01:07.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And there was a huge check-in queue and..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.86,0:01:12.31,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just at the airport.. I was waiting to many people at airport that normally doesn't have those many people there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.77,0:01:17.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um, this flight was reaching two hours early, I could barely manage to get to the boarding
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.28,0:01:19.75,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because of the check-in, the security, it's just..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.75,0:01:20.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Too many people
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.97,0:01:23.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And there were no systems do handle this many people
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.35,0:01:24.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.08,0:01:26.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I reached at the gate at like..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.46,0:01:29.51,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Two minutes or five minutes before the boarding closes
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.51,0:01:32.15,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They allowed me in but they were not very happy with that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.15,0:01:32.51,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.51,0:01:38.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. and you know that somehow these flights don't have these bridges to the plane then you have to go down and take the bus
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.24,0:01:38.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yes
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.68,0:01:39.93,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I hate that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.93,0:01:42.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I hate taking buses to the plane Um..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.04,0:01:45.53,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It's just.. cramp there, it's like hurts getting into a..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.53,0:01:48.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] A vessel and then transporting to somewhere else
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.35,0:01:49.71,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it's weird
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.71,0:01:51.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we took the bus Uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.44,0:01:54.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And went around the airport, eventually reached our plane
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.46,0:02:01.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then I realized that is not a regular plane, was that a smaller propeller ones, like these really small ones <inaudible> or something
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.40,0:01:59.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.82,0:02:07.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I hate those planes, I had.. my worst plane experiences <inaudible> with propeller planes
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.06,0:02:14.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I think they were not equipped to handle bad weather for starters and they just don't work very well with that weather it's not ideal for them
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.40,0:02:15.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.06,0:02:18.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Bad then it was a little bit to late to me to say, I don't wanna travel
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.55,0:02:18.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.42,0:02:21.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I said, let's see how it goes
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.37,0:02:24.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] These guys were really pushing us because we were late or something..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.44,0:02:29.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And they were just heading us to our seats, and them just said sit down we gonna start soon and everything..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.08,0:02:29.51,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.62,0:02:33.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And they were a bit rude, not very pleasant to <inaudible> 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.66,0:02:35.33,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.33,0:02:43.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we were in ours seats, we were ready to fly and then this announcement that says, Hey we can not fly right now because well the flight control says..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.17,0:02:47.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The weather is bad for take-off or something and then we are grounded for now..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.26,0:02:47.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.68,0:02:49.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we don't know how long it will take
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.82,0:02:54.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And at part of time I thought what the heck, why they hiding it from us in that point of time then..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.35,0:02:57.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You must know this for some time given the other flights that <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.86,0:02:59.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.86,0:03:04.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <inaudible> We were the tarmac, waiting to take-off for one hour
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.95,0:03:11.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And this.. they don't even switch on the air conditioning or something in this plane, so we were just sitting there almost no oxygen then..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.46,0:03:14.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just crowded up in this really small place
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.17,0:03:18.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was just Uh.. <breath> just too frustrating experience just..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.00,0:03:20.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Even before the flight took-off..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.82,0:03:30.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] i admit it did take-off, we have a.. we.. we went to the runway and took-off, the took-off was a bit shaky wasn't the most ideal one
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.37,0:03:33.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Probably was too windy for then, to handle such a light plane
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.66,0:03:37.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um, we climb up to this Uh.. cruising altitude and..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.80,0:03:43.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like all, what we do is lose a belt <inaudible> people want to use the lavatories
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.48,0:03:45.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Apparently they told us not we could do that..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.95,0:03:49.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We can take off ours sit belts, because was turbulence all the time
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.62,0:03:53.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The plane started moving from left to right because it was to shaky 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.24,0:03:57.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They stopped the use of the lavatories <inaudible> after some time
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.60,0:04:02.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um, as we were stuck in our sit, the plane just shaking and.. Um..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.46,0:04:05.73,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] In my head I'm thinking what in the heck do I take this plane? I could've..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.17,0:04:10.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Spend a little more money and actually save my life or.. and not having this experience
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.51,0:04:09.33,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.62,0:04:15.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just when I was crossing my mind, it gets worst
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.55,0:04:17.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The lights go off, of the plane
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.55,0:04:24.15,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Apparently there was too much turbulence and then some systems just got damaged or flawed or something.. the lights go off..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.15,0:04:31.13,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And.. it's lighting outside so we had these flashes of light coming in for us, seeming like a horror movie where..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.13,0:04:35.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We were in a plane thousands of feet in the air and suddenly there is..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.17,0:04:38.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] There is no light there, there is light outside and..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.33,0:04:36.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.60,0:04:44.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We started felling like the.. you know.. when the turbulence goes up the plane and forces <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.40,0:04:48.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] At the end of this free falling (speed?) I feel like that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.64,0:04:52.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Not just for momentary but for like.. Twenty seconds
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.48,0:04:55.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It's like it felt three hundred, for hundred feet
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.02,0:05:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And.. I have.. I had big issues with this claustrophobia.. the place already crowded up..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.60,0:05:04.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I'm not feeling well anyway
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.35,0:05:06.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And now this happens
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.35,0:05:10.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it doesn't stop it just keep going up and then falling really fast
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.60,0:05:15.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And going up and falling really fast, and in one point of time the oxygen masks dropped
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.17,0:05:19.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] At that time.. I'm.. I'm gonna die it's my last flight ever
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.77,0:05:20.13,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.13,0:05:21.51,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it's not gonna go well
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.51,0:05:23.51,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I don't know how to use these masks
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.51,0:05:27.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We never had this experience so the guys next to me kinda help me to put this on
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.37,0:05:32.33,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <inaudible> but then for the next fifteen, twenty minutes we were just doing this
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.33,0:05:36.71,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They will try to climb up the altitude and then fall again and do this again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.48,0:05:45.31,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Terrible, terrible having a experience like we had, shaky plane Uh.. If I only think about that night, just so scared about it
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.86,0:05:52.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] After go fifteen, twenty minutes, it kinda stabilized Uh.. Probably we were reaching our destination so they started to..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.95,0:05:57.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The lights came on again.. We took off our masks and started the descent
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.20,0:05:58.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.40,0:06:06.11,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Even the landing was bumping.. <inaudible> twice before it landed
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.48,0:06:09.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] At that part I decided to myself, I will never gonna fly again
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.64,0:06:15.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] At least not in <inaudible> I'm gonna make sure it's not a small plane, not a propeller one for sure no way I'm doing that
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.97,0:06:19.71,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I canceled my flight back because it probably would be the same plane
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.71,0:06:25.33,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. I took the train, took me twice the time or three times of the time but at least I was safer
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.33,0:06:31.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Even now I think I would never Uh.. take night flight out of this place and..
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.60,0:06:33.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Especially if it's a propeller plane
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.44,0:06:37.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The first think I will know before to book any flight it's what plane it is, what time it's flying
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.55,0:06:40.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Before I can even think what is the price I've to pay for it
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.62,0:06:42.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was just a annoying, annoying experience and a scary one
