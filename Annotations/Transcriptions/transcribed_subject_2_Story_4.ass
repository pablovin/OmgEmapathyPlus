Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.88,0:00:08.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah um..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.51,0:00:10.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Have you been traveling recently?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.28,0:00:12.71,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Did you travel somewhere recently?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.34,0:00:14.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.71,0:00:16.51,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So, the last week so so?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.51,0:00:19.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Three weeks ago or something.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.65,0:00:21.11,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah ok. Had any trouble?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.88,0:00:21.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] No.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.62,0:00:23.25,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah ok. That's great.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.25,0:00:26.11,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. I was traveling last week uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.25,0:00:31.05,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I had to go to Brussels, which is not that far away, so I could technically take a train
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.05,0:00:36.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But I've found this deal online on (company name?) and It was a really cheap flight, so I could fly to there.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.85,0:00:41.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So i took it. I didn't realize.. I mean I did see that it was in the night, so a night flight
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.68,0:00:48.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But I didn't realize It was that late, so It was at ten and most of the flights in Europe from airports don't fly at night or (something?)
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.80,0:00:51.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That was like the last flight or so.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.08,0:00:53.05,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] At ten ten PM
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.05,0:01:01.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. So I reached the airport and It was dark already and It was.. ah.. pretty stormy because the I think the rain were forecasted or something
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.02,0:01:08.11,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I reached there and there is a huge queue for check in, because apparently a lot of flights were delayed and everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.11,0:01:13.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. So It took me like almost one hour to get through the check in and everything
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.88,0:01:25.25,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] (I arrived?) early for the flight but then I realized that I.. while I was checking in there were fifteen to going minutes for me to do the check in, do the security <inaudible> and actually finishing my boarding.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.25,0:01:31.45,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] By the time I managed to reach the boarding, they were kind of closing It down, but they let me in.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.48,0:01:40.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we boarded the plane.  Um.. So you known Uh.. When you board in some of the airports don`t have the bridges, so you have to get down and the bus takes you to the plane.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.40,0:01:42.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was one of those um..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.40,0:01:48.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which already.. I was already started do fell a bit grumpy about it because I don't like that ah..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.94,0:01:57.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But when we reached the plane we realized.. or I realized there was a really small plane, you know this propeller small plane with seventy seats or something
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.22,0:01:59.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I hate those.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.22,0:02:06.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because of these propellers I never fell safe on it. I like the jet planes or something a little more secure in my head at least.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.25,0:02:14.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Well, It was this propeller plane and at that point I had no option but to just board the plane. so I boarded it and um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.42,0:02:25.05,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They were hurrying up.. hurrying us up, because the the flight was kind of late <inaudible> we seat on our places <inaudible> as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.05,0:02:30.71,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then we find out that ah.. the air traffic control didn't allow us..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.71,0:02:34.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] the plane to take off because of the storm and everything
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.60,0:02:41.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the other flights waiting to take off before us. So we stand on the tarmac for one hour waiting for a plane to (actually?) stopped
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.85,0:02:47.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Already going pretty well, It gets worse I tell you.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.28,0:02:46.91,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.91,0:02:54.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. After waiting for one hour they don't give us water and they don't switch the air conditioner on the tarmac.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.60,0:02:57.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was terrible. We could hardly..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.74,0:02:59.91,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] There was not much oxygen left in the plane.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.51,0:03:00.05,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.05,0:03:06.11,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And suddenly they said ok, now we can go to the take off <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.40,0:03:12.91,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. we took off ah.. It was a bit shaky the take off as well, the plane was going all over the place and..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.91,0:03:16.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Once we reached this cruising altitude um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.74,0:03:22.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Shortly after that, It this.. there was too much turbulence because there was a storm forecasted.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.74,0:03:29.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was too much turbulence, It was raining heavily, the plane was going from left to right, It was really shaky
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.68,0:03:28.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.25,0:03:34.25,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the seat belt signs were never switched of we had to keep our seat belts on all the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.20,0:03:39.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We couldn't use [inaudible] our seat uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.77,0:03:41.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the things get even worse then.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.48,0:03:48.45,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Suddenly we fell like the air plane is having a fall of one hundred feet or something then
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.45,0:03:51.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. You know that feeling when the plane falls and it is just kind of.. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.80,0:03:56.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was scared like hell at that part of time because i though I was going to die.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.60,0:03:59.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then suddenly the lights completely goes off at the plane.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.11,0:04:12.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. To my misery, for the fist time in my life I experienced this oxygen masks dropping of. I've never used it before, i never had this experience, so..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.22,0:04:16.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the plane is sort of like free falling almost and I can't breath at that point of time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.42,0:04:25.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I can't even put the mask on. I was just shaking with panic at that point. This guy sitting next to me actually helped me to put the mask on.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.20,0:04:27.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Then I could breath again, but uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.97,0:04:33.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] For another couple of ten seconds or so we actually felt the plane going down and down. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.40,0:04:36.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It just felt so.. ah.. scary at that point of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.77,0:04:42.31,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And because the lights in the plane were completely switched off we could see the lightning flashing outside
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.31,0:04:47.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This flashes of light coming inside were so scaring like the horror movies or something.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.60,0:05:03.33,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh.. A few minutes later It kind of stabilize, the lights came on again. We were told to remove our masks and the plane went to the cruse altitude again. I think there was pretty much we were nearing the destination.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.33,0:05:11.73,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh.. But It was really a tough time.  We stand fifteen minutes really (horrifying?). I was completely shaking ah..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.73,0:05:22.13,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Even the landing at that point.. The landing was bumping as well, We just bumped twice before we stabilize on the runway.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.13,0:05:27.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. It was like the most (horrifying?) experience in my life having that flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.66,0:05:32.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I mean.. I'm glad the pilot was able to hand it, but..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.66,0:05:32.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.26,0:05:38.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I'm never gonna take that flight again. On my way back I've canceled my flight, and I took the train back uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.20,0:05:42.13,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It took me more time but I was at least safe, in my head.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.06,0:05:48.33,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Probably I'm never gonna take a flight for a short distance again, at least if I know the plane is a small plane, then I'll never take.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.33,0:05:50.33,Default,,0,0,0,,
