Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Okay great where were we before we were interrupted um..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.64,0:00:07.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Okay so <laughs> so after my friend had left
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.38,0:00:10.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] For ages shortly after she had left I was a bit down in the dumps kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.82,0:00:16.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I didn't really uh I just lost my close friend, I needed a kind of way to distract myself in some sense
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.26,0:00:18.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er so I started to get a lot into music kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.76,0:00:22.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. do you like music? [L]  Yeah, I love music
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.24,0:00:25.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Oh very good, cause I really got into music kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.16,0:00:28.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I really wanted my parents to buy me an instrument kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.00,0:00:30.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like a guitar or something, so it kind of er..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.94,0:00:35.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Kind of <laughs> get out, kind of get out of my system
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.50,0:00:38.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] My parents viewed it more as a kind of phase essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.00,0:00:41.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just something I was going through, so they did kind of ignore me in some regard
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.90,0:00:45.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] To a large extent kind of, they just thought it would pass
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.28,0:00:49.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But I just kept nagging them so it's like <laughs> it became a bit of a balance there
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.54,0:00:56.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The closest I can get was eventually I convinced them to send me to a music oriented high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.18,0:00:58.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Once I graduated from middle school essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.48,0:01:04.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So essentially they allowed me to go this kind of more, high school with a more emphasis on music
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.14,0:01:09.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] If I could also go and attend normal, real classes there kind of <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.10,0:01:11.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And not just these weird musical classes
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.80,0:01:14.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that went great kind of, the school was very nice
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.66,0:01:19.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I had a lot of fun there, the food was good, a bit better than here <laughs> [L] <laughs> 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.46,0:01:25.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so yeah no I really enjoyed going to school there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.26,0:01:28.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But there was one thing I, one problem, one major problem I had with that school
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.24,0:01:32.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] There was this one mandatory course called er classical music theory [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.78,0:01:36.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And.. the problem with this course was I really..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.98,0:01:41.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I'm pretty sure the teacher was a kind of demon in the shape of a human kind of thing [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.06,0:01:44.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was pretty awful, she used to really yell at students
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.62,0:01:48.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And belittle them, and like drag students around by the ear and stuff, it was pretty bad [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.84,0:01:53.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I.. I really did not like this teacher <laughs> she was pretty awful
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.02,0:01:56.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah the good thing was that I actually met a couple people like me
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.04,0:01:59.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And some of those students took her class, and I essentially bonded with these four guys kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.30,0:02:03.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Over just hating this particular teacher because she was just an awful human being kind of <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.52,0:02:06.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah which was interesting <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.68,0:02:11.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But yeah and that continued on for about a year, I went to this school kind of, I really enjoyed myself
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.04,0:02:16.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] After one year essentially we had to give this presentation on classical music theory
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.60,0:02:20.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] In front of the entire class, and I was very nervous about this because I was still very shy
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.72,0:02:22.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And shy kind of as a person at that point in time [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.94,0:02:26.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So partially just having to present in front of the entire class was a problem
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.44,0:02:30.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then the fact that I had to present in front of this teacher which I was just terrified of essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.36,0:02:32.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause she was just evil <laughs> um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.88,0:02:35.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I did spend a lot of time like practicing and preparing for this
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.36,0:02:38.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I rehearsed and I kind of, well I felt fairly confident [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.06,0:02:40.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I went up and I gave the presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.36,0:02:44.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And people laughed and they applauded when I was done, I thought I'd done a really good job
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.38,0:02:48.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um but once I was done, the teacher really like laid into my presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.02,0:02:51.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like no this wrong, why did you say this, you can't mean this, why did you do this
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.86,0:02:56.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Can you just speak louder? It's like.. and I was really like distraught after this kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.80,0:03:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I was a very fragile person, so I actually had to go like, I basically cried essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.00,0:03:07.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I went back home and I told my parents I can't deal with this kind of, this is too much for me um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.22,0:03:10.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we had to go and with the school kind of, see if we could do anything about it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.90,0:03:15.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But like the school said that basically she's on a bunch of boards, we can't get rid of her, so she's basically there to stay
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.82,0:03:19.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah and I couldn't just deal with her anymore like because it was a mandatory course
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.86,0:03:22.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Sure but like, couldn't handle her for another two years er.. [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.42,0:03:26.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So eventually we discussed and like we decided to send me to like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.92,0:03:30.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This musical high school shared a lot of courses with the normal high school essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.22,0:03:34.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I could transfer over to the normal without like impacting my studies too much
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.84,0:03:38.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And my parents were also happy I was back to a more technical subject as well <laughs> [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.90,0:03:42.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I, yeah I eventually went to the normal high school and finished my curriculum there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.64,0:03:48.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was a shame I couldn't finish at the musical school but you know <laughs> life [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.86,0:03:53.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. I did actually meet up with one of the guys that went to the musical school when I went to college
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.54,0:03:58.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I went to college, I met up with, I found <inaudible> in the corridor, said hey how are you doing?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.62,0:04:03.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we talked a bit and it's ah no we're still playing in this band kind of er..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.26,0:04:05.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] With the other four guys I'd met earlier on
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.86,0:04:10.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then he said like ah you should join us some time, it would be fun. I was like me? <laughs> [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.74,0:04:13.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It's like yeah, yeah, I remember you're good at singing. Like really? Oh, okay
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.34,0:04:17.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I actually did sing for them as vocalist
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.56,0:04:20.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I did sing and we played and we practiced a bit kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.02,0:04:25.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And eventually we arranged to have a bit of a like concert for um.. some of our friends and
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.26,0:04:28.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Close friends and stuff and it's like that was a really good experience
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.60,0:04:33.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause like when we had that concert, I really felt like I was alive kind of, I really felt like I was on cloud nine, it was a great experience [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.32,0:04:36.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er.. so that was yeah so
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.54,0:04:40.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That's how I got to sing in a band and still keep in touch with them
