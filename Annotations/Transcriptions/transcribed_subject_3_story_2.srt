1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
[S] So cool, where were we before we got rudely interrupted ah..

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,720
[S] Right, I was telling you a little bit about my friend, essentially she moved away

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,520
[S] Now, sometime after she moved away, I actually started to get more into music.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:21,300
[S] Or like I guess I didn't listen a lot to music so I was I guess interested in the idea of playing an instrument cause I thought it was like a really cool thing, like would be a rock star-esque kind of thing

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,520
[S] Um.. so I pestered my parents for this

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,280
[S] Naturally, I don't really have a musical bone in my body. Are you a musician? Do you play any instruments?

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,480
[L] Yeah, I do, some. But not professionally.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,160
[S] <laughs> just playing around

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,360
[L] Playing around, yeah. [S] Yeah, okay, fair enough.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,780
[S] But uh yeah, I tried to pester them, I wanna try this guitar and stuff, I wanna do this, I wanna do that

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,040
[S] They just kind of, they didn't really believe in it much, they just kind of thought it was a phase, it would go over

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,540
[S] Hopefully be a bit cheaper if I didn't get into all of this stuff ah..

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,300
[S] So I pestered them for it and they didn't really buy me anything too exciting

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:01,420
[S] What they did eventually do for me is I managed to pester them into letting me go to a kind of a musical high school essentially

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,440
[S] Like where you could do all the normal subjects

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,960
[L] Yeah [S] But then you could like these extra like er musical courses on the side kind of to get deeper into it

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,960
[S] And I really enjoyed going to this school, kind of, I leaned a lot um..

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,280
[S] Um but there was one course I had a problem with and that was music theory

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
[S] And the reason I had a problem with was this course in particular is that there was this one teacher

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
[S] And I'm pretty sure she was some kind of a demon wearing the skin of a human kind of thing [L] <laughs>

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
[S] It was pretty bad <laughs> like she was pretty evil um

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,840
[S] And just mean, and she used to drag kids around by the ears kind of and stuff like that

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,200
[S] So it was like really borderline not okay kind of stuff <breath> um..

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,500
[S] And I actually did meet some friends when I went to this high school kind of

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,200
[S] Just and we all kind of just bonded around hating this particular woman kind of <laughs>

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,180
[S] So it's a bit yeah it's a bit unfortunate but she was really not a great person kind of um

27
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,600
[S] So like we spent some, I spent some time there, I learned a lot kind of

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,380
[S] But then there was this one point in time where we had to give this presentation kind of

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,900
[S] We had to give this presentation in classical musical theory, given by this woman who was a bit evil um

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,040
[S] And I was really nervous because we were supposed to give this presentation around everybody kind of

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,740
[S] And I was partially nervous because I wanted to do a good job, get a good grade

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,980
[S] And partially because I was terrified of getting yelled at essentially like for being stupid or whatever um..

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,660
[S] So I did prepare a lot, I was very nervous. I did manage to give the talk, I gave the presentation.

34
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,760
[S] And I thought I'd done a good job, like everyone was clapping

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,400
[S] But then like she really laid into me after the talk like

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,260
[S] She really like went for me kind of <laughs> it was pretty bad like <breath>

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,980
[S] She said why did you do this? This wasn't right, this was wrong, you should've said this, you need to speak up more kind of

38
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,800
[S] And I was really like <breath> I was pretty devastated after this

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,260
[S] Cause really it was very harsh critique, and a lot of it was mean spirited kind of

40
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,680
[S] So I, like I went home crying kind of

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,100
[S] And I told my parents like, look I can't be in this school with doing this teacher anymore

42
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,620
[S] Cause I needed like.. that course to pass and get my grades kind of, well get my exam

43
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,700
[S] But uh I also was gonna start to do things with this teacher

44
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
[S] And we had talked to the school about this teacher before, but we couldn't get rid of her kind of

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,980
[S] They just said like no there's nothing we can do really like, she's gonna stay is what we were basically told [L] Hmm

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,580
[S] So we did eventually manage to organize that I would be able to transfer into the normal schooling system

47
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,840
[S] Which shared some of the courses with this music school um..

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,380
[S] And I kind of finished my high school year, well years, while I was there kind of

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,420
[S] It was.. not ideal, I would have obviously have preferred to stay at the music school kind of <breath>

50
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,080
[S] I wasn't gonna stay there with her <laughs> not a chance, not a chance, yeah..

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,620
[S] So yeah, eventually I graduated kind of, and more, with a little bit more of technical focus at school um..

52
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,820
[S] Ended up in college and, when I got to college I actually did meet like the people I like eh that I went to music school with

53
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
[S] Cause they'd also gone there <breath> um..

54
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,720
[S] And they kind of, I talked to them a bit and like..

55
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,260
[S] They said hey we're starting a band, do you wanna join? And I was like me? <laughs>

56
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,220
[S] Like, really? Like yeah, we remember you used to be a pretty good vocalist kind of

57
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,400
[S] Wow, wow. Yeah, vocalist. So.. [L] Vocalist.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,280
[S] Yeah eventually I said yeah, sure, I'd love to kind of like

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,500
[S] Cause I was really uh I still really liked music

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,900
[S] Yeah I just have kind of put it to one side essentially because such traumatic experiences basically <breath> um..

61
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,880
[S] So like eventually not too long after I met them in college kind of we all decided to like go and hold this concert there

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,100
[S] So we had our first concert and like it went great I felt like I was on the cloud, walking on clouds kind of

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,220
[S] I felt like a god, it was amazing <laughs>

64
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,320
[S] Yeah so eventually yeah that's what ended up, I eventually ended up as the vocalist in a band

65
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,900
[S] So yeah, pretty good <laughs> [S] Yeah, I'm amazed that I actually got there kind of, I thought it was over, but yeah

66
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,460
[S] <breath> Yeah, that was a great experience. [L] Yeah, it was, probably.
