1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
[S] How has your weekend been? [L] Weekend? Was nice.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:09,680
[L] I guess I'm most of the time at home, relaxing.. yeah [S] Yeah, yeah, I know, I know that feeling <laughs>

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,480
[S] Yeah, I guess. Today I'm gonna tell you two stories about myself um..

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,420
[S] First off, would you think you.. would you say that you're an introvert?

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,520
[L] Um.. I would say so

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,380
[S] Yeah.. I guess you kind of have to to be a computer scientist right? It's hard to avoid <laughs> [L] Yeah.. yeah <laughs>

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,240
[S] Cause I'd say I'm also pretty introverted obviously um..

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
[S] Especially when I was younger, that was a big thing, I grew up in South Africa

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,080
[S] And it's very easy to be introverted there cause you spend a lot of time at home essentially [L] Hmm

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,780
[S] I spent a lot of times playing video games on my own, I..

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,060
[S] It was a bit lonely but I didn't really mind, like I enjoy being by myself kind of

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,880
[S] That was good for me.. uh.. [L] Uh-huh cool

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,200
[S] I didn't know, I always thought that people in Africa like

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,420
[S] Like to enjoy time outside <laughs> [L] <laughs> ah well I'm, I'm a bit special <laughs>

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,240
[S] Yeah but uh yeah and I was like that for most of my youth

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,860
[S] Um and that was fairly

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,740
[S] Uh average thing for me until.. it did change a bit when I moved to sweden

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,320
[S] So I moved to Sweden at around age of

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,680
[S] 11, 12 I think? Uh is when I moved um..

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,680
[S] And once again I became a bit, a bit more introverted

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,720
[S] Cause I'm now in a new country and I don't speak the language <laughs> kind of it's like [L] <laughs>

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,100
[S] Uh yeah so that didn't help um [L] Interesting

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,020
[S] And it took me quite a while to find a new friend

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,660
[S] One of the first friends I found was actually a girl from class

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,360
[S] So I started in like this middle, lower middle school class kind of um..

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,660
[S] And I met this girl there, and she was really fascinating to me cause she was very outgoing

27
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,100
[S] Very kind of brave, very independent

28
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,320
[S] Which was like the exact opposite of me cause I was like shy, introverted, and scared of everything.. uh.. [L] Uh-huh

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,200
[S] And we spent a lot of time together, because we, I spent time like watching cartoons together

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,080
[S] Playing video games, and coming up, like going, going around doing like, yeah, it was pretty great [L] Nice

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,920
[S] Ah going around causing mischief and stuff uh

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,180
[L] So it helped you a lot like to.. <inaudible> on your life [S] Yeah, she really helped like

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,420
[S] Yeah, get going, it really helped me like kind of settle and get into the conf, self confidence you know? Uh.. [L] Uh-huh

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,400
[S] Uh one of the things that we did do actually was that we lived very close to like a lumber processing plant

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,980
[S] Was where they keep all the wood for like making furniture

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,980
[S] So they had a big yard where they had all these wooden planks and stuff [L] Hmm

37
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,240
[S] Uh so what her and me would do is she would sneak in

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,500
[S] And we would kind of take planks, and we would steal planks

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,460
[S] And we would use these to build like a go cart essentially

40
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,740
[S] So we had this uh box essentially, and then we had wheels on the side

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,920
[S] And her and me over the weekends would kind of build this up, so we would like

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,520
[S] Nail new boards there, we could add an extra seat

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,540
[S] And then we would add like a trunk, and then we would add (spoilers?) to make it go faster or something

44
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,720
[S] I don't know, we were kids, we weren't the smartest people <laughs> [L] Uh-huh <laughs>

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,720
[S] Uh and what we did was that we would usually

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,960
[S] Take this and then put it on top of a hill, right? So I had this big sloping hill next to my house

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,780
[S] And it was asphalted so it was like very, pretty good for speed <laughs> eh.. [L] Yeah <laughs>

48
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,460
[S] And so we.. no, we will get there [L] It's not so safe <inaudible>

49
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,580
[S] Cause I actually did actually injure myself quite a lot, so what we do is we  let it fall down kind of this hill um..

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,020
[S] There was this one day where we rolled it, we rolled it top of the hill, I sat in

51
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,340
[S] And then she was gonna like just let me, uh let me go down the hill

52
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,920
[S] But instead she kind of really pushed me, essentially, so she really rocketed me down the hill kind of [L] <laughs>

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,640
[S] And I, I was like holding on for dear life and I was really like sp, spazzing out

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,140
[S] And but then the thing started to wobble and it turned to the side, and it flipped kind of

55
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,680
[S] And then but so then I stuck onto the side, but I was still stuck in it, right? So my legs were still stuck in the go cart [L] <laughs>

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,340
[L] Woah [S] Ah so then the only thing I could do was I had to brace with the right side of my body

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,820
[S] And so I kind of scraped the asphalt for a couple of feet

58
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,580
[S] And there was like I lost a lot of skin, there was a lot of blood kind of <breath> [L] <breath>

59
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,880
[S] I was screaming and crying, she was screaming and crying

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,560
[S] And like I was like paralyzed, couldn't do anything like [L] <laughs>

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,640
[S] So she had to run off and fetch my dad, like to come and save me from this mess that I'd put myself in [L] <laughs>

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,940
[S] Uh yeah it was pretty.. it was pretty bad [L] Intense

63
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,060
[S] It was pretty intense yeah, but it's the kind of like

64
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,600
[S] It's the kind of stuff that you remember, right? So this is the kind of

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,780
[S] So it's kind of, I didn't really regret it, even though it was very, very stupid <laughs>

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,480
[S] I didn't really regret, cause that was the kind of stuff you remember when you remember when you're a bit older, right?

67
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,920
[S] These things you did as a kid that would probably kill me if I did them now, right? [L] Yeah

68
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,460
[L] And you never played with her again like after this [S] Ah.. I mean

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
[S] We play for quite eh um

70
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,700
[S] Her and me did play with each other for quite a long time after this

71
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,260
[S] Although it didn't last for that long actually, cause I'd known her for like..

72
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,520
[S] 6 or 7 months I think

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,720
[S] And then she let me know that her dad had got a job in Asia [L] Hmm

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,940
[S] Ah and her family would be moving, so it's like [L] Hmm

75
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,660
[S] I was very worried about this kind of

76
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,900
[S] Cause I'd just met this new friend, like kind of in this new country <laughs> finally>

77
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,260
[L] She became like your best friend and all, she was [S] Yeah, yeah, she became a really good friend

78
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,840
[S] And now like she's moving, it's like fuck, it's like goddammit what am I gonna do now [L] Hmm

79
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,140
[S] Ah we did exchange phone numbers to try and keep in touch kind of, but uh..

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,820
[S] When she did move over there, I tried to call her, and it didn't work too well kind of

81
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,800
[S] Cause like apparently Swedish sim cards don't work that well in China, so like [L] Yeah

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,660
[S] It didn't like, we had a lot of trouble like, we didn't really get

83
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,500
[S] Weren't able to get in touch with each other, so she just kind of disappeared, which was

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,820
[S] Yeah it [L] Especially when you are young, I think

85
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,200
[S] Yeah you're fragile and sensitive when you're that young, it's very dangerous [L] Yeah

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,900
[S] Uh so that was.. uh she spoke English to me luckily <laughs> [L] She speak our language in that time?

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,200
[S] Ah yeah so I did lose contact with her for a while

88
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,300
[S] And this was before like facebook and stuff, so I couldn't really get in touch with her

89
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,800
[S] Uh so it went a couple of years before I heard from her again kind of [L] Hmm

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,220
[S] I think it was about five years uh..

91
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,880
[S] And then when she did actually contact me on facebook, like later on, five years later

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,980
[S] Right? And it's like when I got the message from her, I was like wow you're still alive that's amazing <laughs> [L] <laughs>

93
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,380
[S] Um.. but.. yeah <laughs> [L] Recovering from that incident, right? <laughs>

94
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,320
[S] It took me that long to recover, it's like, well it was like, it was a pretty long time later kind of

95
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,860
[S] And then we started to chat like about like ah

96
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,780
[S] What her and me had done in the past kind of

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,340
[S] Like how we were as people, how we were in life now, like what we were doing

98
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,600
[S] Uh.. and we talked for a while about this, but I realized that like

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
[S] After she'd moved she'd changed a lot

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,220
[S] Then I guess that I'd also changed a lot as well, just kind of because it's like you change a lot when you're a kid, right?

101
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,020
[L] Ah.. also because of the culture that's different in a [S] Ah so we talked

102
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,520
[S] Yeah the culture, and like changing, just finding new friends [L] Yeah

103
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,480
[S] And stuff, you become a different person, you get different hobbies and stuff uh

104
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,300
[S] So she had changed a lot.. yeah, I, I, I got worse, this is yeah [L] Forgot you <laughs>

105
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,980
[S] Um but yeah, she had changed a lot and I had changed a lot

106
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,840
[S] So we talked for a while, but like the conversation just kind of, the messages kept getting shorter

107
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,600
[S] And we didn't really like talk that much after a while, eventually we just stopped talking [L] Yeah

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,320
[S] And I haven't really talked to her ever since, which is a shame but

109
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,860
[S] I guess that's how life is I guess

110
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,020
[S] You live, you learn, you keep growing [L] Yeah

111
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,300
[S] Right? <laughs> yeah, yeah [L] <laughs> this is true
