1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
[S] So where were we before we were interrupted er.. rudely [L] Emily

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,460
[L] <laughs> [S] Emily, yes, Emily, so

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,300
[S] Emily moved away and that was a bit unfortunate kind of um.. [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,780
[S] I did start start to cope with that eventually after some point in time [L] Yep

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,740
[S] Ah.. I started to get very into music actually. Did you know that I, I can, I sing for a band [L] Um.. um

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,100
[L] I do know that, no, I do know that, that's cool [S] Well, I can sing at all <laughs> yeah

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,100
[S] So I did actually sing a bit er.. in a band

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,200
[S] I can tell you a bit about that kind of, so as I said, I did actually get quite into music kind of [L] Yeah, sure

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,640
[S] It was a kind of a coping mechanism, I guess, I don't know, cause she left [L] Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,820
[S] Ah.. and I kind of nagged my parents like I wanted instruments kind of

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,780
[S] Had seen all these videos of people like playing instruments

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,620
[S] So and showing how to play chords, and I <inaudible> it looked really cool [L] Okay, yeah

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,640
[L] Okay [S] So I nagged my parents for a guitar and stuff

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
[S] They didn't really fall for it kind of <laughs> [L] Uh-huh

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,200
[S] They wanted me to focus on other stuff kind of [L] <laughs>

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,280
[S] So they just treated it as like a phase that I was going through and I would get over it eventually [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,240
[S] And.. the best I could do to kind of convince them, was that when I was going to a..

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,820
[S] So this was it, when I was transitioning into high school kind of [L] Uh-huh

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,860
[S] Is that I convinced them to kind of send me to one of these kind of

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,860
[S] Special schools which had a big music like curriculum kind of, so it's like [L] Yeah, okay, yeah, that's nice

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,040
[S] They agreed as long as the school had like proper subjects like maths and like [L] <laughs> yeah

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,280
[S] Chemistry and stuff, so I could still get a proper education while I'm doing this kind of fluffier stuff [L] Yeah, okay.. yeah

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,080
[L] Fluffy <laughs> [S] <laughs> it is a bit fluffy, right?

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,460
[S] Uh yeah, so I did convince them to do it, to let me do that eventually, and I went to this school [L] Yeah

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,120
[S] I'd say it was a.. very good school kind of

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,820
[S] I enjoyed myself quite a lot there, like the teachers were good [L] Yeah

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,960
[S] The food was good, better than here <laughs> of course [L] <laughs> of course

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
[L] That's a very easy baseline <laughs> to beat [S] Yeah it's a low, it's a low bar

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,920
[S] It's a low bar <laughs> [L] <laughs>

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,180
[S] Um but yeah so.. I had a great time there

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,180
[S] Well I really enjoyed school, I really enjoyed <inaudible>

32
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,200
[S] One thing I didn't like on school, is there was this one course

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,720
[S] It was called classical music theory [L] Okay

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,420
[S] And the reason I didn't like this course, there was this one teacher that we had and she was just..

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,360
[S] A really bad person, she was pretty awful

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
[S] She was like a demon in the shape of a human kind of <laughs> [L] <laughs>

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,920
[S] Um and she used to be like, she used to yell a lot at students [L] Yeah

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,400
[S] Sometimes she used to like drag students by their ears kind of [L] Hmm.. hmm

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,660
[S] Like bordering on like slightly abusive, a bit on the abusive side, which isn't great

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,320
[L] Uh that's not good.. yeah, yeah [S] No, it's not good

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,760
[L] Yeah [S] Um.. and I actually did, I actually meet friends kind of, we went to the same, we went to the same class

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,740
[S] That she was holding kind of, so we kind of bonded over hating this one particular teacher kind of [L] <laughs>

43
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,480
[S] She was so awful [L] Yeah, yeah

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,140
[S] Ah.. so yeah, but otherwise I, yeah I spent a lot of time with them

45
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,700
[S] And I like really enjoyed going to that school um..

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,420
[S] I continued for about one year into the school term kind of [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh

47
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,760
[S] Uh and then we were supposed to..

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,840
[S] So I wasn't, wasn't at the school for my entire school thing, and I'm gonna tell you why

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,860
[S] Because essentially after one year we had to give this presentation in classical music theory

50
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,900
[S] This is a mandatory course, so you know that you get your grade in your final exam [L] Ah, okay.. yeah

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,600
[S] You need to do this mandatory like classical music course [L] Okay, yeah, yeah, yea

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,060
[S] And there was this big presentation we were supposed to do in front of the class and everyone

53
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,640
[S] And in front of this teacher

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,120
[S] And I was terrified of doing this presentation, like it was, it was ah [L] <laughs>

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,440
[S] It was, it was very uncomfortable kind of, partially I'm not, I wasn't a very outgoing person back then [L] Yeah

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,580
[S] I've become more outgoing over time, I don't know if you've noticed <laughs> um [L] <laughs>

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,820
[S] But uh I wasn't very outgoing back then

58
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,760
[S] But now I'm er well like so it was stressful for me

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,920
[S] Ah and also I had to give in front of this teacher kind of [L] Hmm

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,540
[S] Who was like my nightmare kind of turned into a real person [L] Yeah. yeah, your, your demon

61
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,800
[S] Yeah, my, my own personal demon in some sense ah.. [L] <laughs> yeah

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,200
[S] So I prepared a lot for this, and I prepared slides, prepared to the talk and like

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,060
[S] Well I, I, when, the day, the day the presentation came, I gave the presentation [L] Uh-huh

64
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,820
[S] I thought I pretty well, I was pretty happy with it, people applauded, but then like [L] Uh-huh, yeah

65
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,040
[S] As soon as I was done like the teacher really started ripping into my presentation, it's like

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,260
[S] And this was wrong, this was awful, why did you say this, this was just not right

67
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,040
[S] And like I.. really, it was a really hard blow kind of [L] Sure

68
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,220
[S] Cause I was a little bit, I wasn't such a confident person to start with, kind of [L] Sure, yeah

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,480
[S] So it's like the fact that she kind of would rip into something that I'd done made me feel really bad [L] Yeah, yeah

70
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,960
[L] <inaudible> yeah [S] <laughs> so I just went home to my parents and I was like a wreck kind of

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,800
[S] Like I told them like, look this is what happened, I'm really unhappy, can I go do something about this [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,340
[L] Uh-huh [S] Um.. yeah so my parents came and we talked to the school about it

73
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,340
[L] Uh-huh [S] And then like we saw if we could do something about the teacher

74
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,820
[S] And then the school said no, basically the teacher is here to stay kind of

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,180
[S] We can't do anything to get rid of them kind of thing, so I was really uncomfortable [L] <laughs> oh, of course she can be (creepy?) that way

76
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,060
[S] Yeah, I mean, sometimes it's like, you need uh, with certain people

77
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,840
[S] Cause she was very important, she was on some boards, or some direction, or something like that, so I was very unfortunate [L] Okay.. okay.. okay

78
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,560
[L] Uh-huh [S] So we couldn't really get rid of her kind of

79
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,680
[S] Uh and this course was mandatory, and I just really didn't want to go this course with this person [L] Oh that's very sad

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,320
[S] Uh so we talked a bit and we came to the conclusion that we would still be okay if I kind of

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,340
[S] The thing we could do, because the normal high school kind of

82
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,640
[S] Had a lot of courses shared with this music school, so that I could transfer to this normal high school kind of [L] Yeah, okay

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,260
[S] And then just keep going.. um and finish my school curriculum there kind of [L] Okay.. wow

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,280
[L] Okay [S] Which was I thought like, sure as long as I get to avoid this person

85
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
[S] Cause like I don't, I can't handle this kind of [L] Yeah

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,040
[L] Cause you are intimidated by, by her [S] Yeah I was a very, I was a very fragile person, I'd say, back then kind of

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,160
[S] So it wasn't great for me to have to deal with that kind of

88
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,580
[S] Especially because you look up to people in positions of, in like this kind of, er.. [L] Yeah, yeah

89
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,680
[S] Teaching positions essentially, and so it's like [L] Yeah, sure

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,620
[S] When you, any criticism from them becomes very hurtful kind of [L] Uh-huh.. yeah, yeah

91
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,220
[S] Uh so I did eventually swap over to and complete my high school curriculum in this high school kind of

92
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,300
[S] And yeah it was a shame I had to leave but it was a lot less stressful when I transferred over to the normal school kind of

93
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,880
[S] And I, I missed out on some friends, but I made some new friends as well, so that was <breath>

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,760
[S] A bit of a shame but fine for me kind of er.. [L] But that's good I mean, you have supportive parents

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,520
[S] Yeah my parents have been very supportive along the way kind of, so yeah, always [L] Yeah, yeah 

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,200
[S] So they were also pretty, they were probably pretty happy that I was transferred over to a more technical school as well [L] Yeah <laughs>

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
[S] Kind of to be honest but [L] <laughs> yeah

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
[L] But uh in a new environment for you to start

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,640
[S] Yeah, new and, new and more stable environment for me kind of er, which was good [L] Yeah.. yeah, yeah

100
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,980
[S] So I did eventually graduate from high school, I went to college er..

101
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,640
[S] In a more, in a technical thing, in a more technical thing kind of [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,820
[S] And when I went to this <inaudible> it was more like a college

103
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,660
[S] I did actually meet up with on campus these other people I'd gone to what's it

104
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,260
[S] Well I met up with one other people, and then I, eventually we go out together for like a drink and kind of

105
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,300
[S] Uh.. and then I like, we talked at I, like college essentially, about like

106
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,980
[S] How it had been, gone, being for them and how much they still hated the teacher to this day kind of thing and um [L] <laughs>

107
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,340
[L] In college? Okay [S] Yeah in college

108
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,060
[S] So then eventually we talked and chatted a bit and it's like

109
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,080
[S] They told me that they were still playing in this kind of, they'd made some kind of personal band

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,460
[S] And they were still playing with each other kind of, like oh that's cool

111
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,760
[S] And they asked hey would you enjoy to like play with us sometimes? What, me?

112
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,940
[S] <laughs> I was like, surprised that like they'd even want me like [L] Sure, sure

113
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,300
[S] And even remembered I could do anything kind of ah..

114
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,580
[S] So yeah and we got together and we played a bit to each other, we practiced a bit to each other

115
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,640
[S] And then after a couple of months we decided to eventually have like a

116
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,900
[S] We just had play over like just group of friends kind of um [L] Hmm

117
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,180
[L] That must be fun <laughs> [S] Yeah it was really great fun, I felt really like

118
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,440
[S] And I was the vocalist kind of, so I got to sing, and it's like, it was really liberating [L] Yeah

119
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,140
[S] And really cool to kind of just be able to let go and kind of enjoy [L] Yes, yeah, yeah

120
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,960
[S] So I really felt like I was like on the cloud, on clouds, on sky, on cloud nine kind of <laughs> [L] Sure

121
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,760
[S] Thing so that was uh was an amazing experience for me [L] Sure

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,880
[S] And that's kind of how I got into that, and I still chat with them now, to this day so [L] Nice, nice

123
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,340
[L] Nice, wow, hmm [S] <laughs> yeah
