[S] this um.. do you know these kind of places where they keep planks before they process them for.. to make furniture kinda so they have these big like yards with planks around 

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,625
[L] yeah..

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,825
[S] 'cause me and her lived actually very close to one of these yards kinda so what we'd do is it we kinda of sneak in there and we kinda of steal planks kinda from the place <laughs> and what we'd do with these planks is we kind 

32
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,050
[L] <laughs>
[S] 'cause me and her lived actually very close to one of these yards kinda so what we'd do is it we kinda of sneak in there and we kinda of steal planks kinda from the place <laughs> and what we'd do with these planks is we kind

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:17,275
[S] and take the planks and build them into like go karts essentially so we kind of nailed it together put some wheels on it kind of like put in..  add things we added an extra seat we added a trunk

35
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,200
[S] kind of uh.. and then we added some (spoils?) to make it go faster or something I don't know we were kids <laughs> we just thought it was cool uh.. and what we would do is once we build this thing we had 
[L] <laughs>

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,900
[S] kind of uh.. and then we added some (spoils?) to make it go faster or something I don't know we were kids <laughs> we just thought it was cool uh.. and what we would do is once we build this thing we had 

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,000

[S] we had like this sloping like.. hill next to my house which was asphalted like this asphalted sloping.. slope next to my house

42
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:44,625
[S] what we'd do is that we'd take this go kart and then put in to the top of a hill and then someone's in the go kart and it would kind of roll down the hill kind of, does it sound like a good idea?

43
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,000

48
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:07,275
[S] particularly 'cause we got this thing to the top of the hill alright so <inaudible> we took it to the <inaudible> top of the hill then I sat in it and then normally we'd just let it roll down but this time she kinda

49
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,175
[S] pushed me down like with the speed so I was like trying to hold down as I'm going down the hill really fast and I was like bobbling and this thing turned and flipped kinda and the thing is I was still in this right? 'cause my leg 

50
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,925
[L] <laughs>
[S] pushed me down like with the speed so I was like trying to hold down as I'm going down the hill really fast and I was like bobbling and this thing turned and flipped kinda and the thing is I was still in this right? 'cause my leg

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:26,975
[S] was still inside the go kart and then like the <inaudible> of my body was outside the kart so what happened was while I was like.. while I it was going down the hill kind of I had.. it kinda flipped and then I had to kinda brace I could only brace with the right side of 

53
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,175
[S] my body so I had to brace against the asphalt with the right side of my body and I had to skied a bit kind of and I got.. I really <inaudible> off my (little?) skin on my arm kind of and I got very bloody

65
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,650
[S] things like.. it sadly didn't last for too long 'cause I had know her for a couple of months like about half a year or so

66
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,950
[L] <laughs>

70
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:24,800
[S] and then she eventually let me know that she.. her dad had gotten a job in Asia essentially so that means that her and her family had to move kinda.. and this

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:35,100
[S] really worried me kind of 'cause I was obviously like still a bit fragile and like.. uh.. so I was a bit scared of losing a friend kind of I was afraid o being lonely uh.. we exchanged phone numbers kinda 

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:45,125
[S] kinda so we could call each other when she moved uh.. this didn't really work kinda so I tried to call her and just couldn't like get through I guess Swedish sim cards didn't work too well and this was a bit before 

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:54,875
[S] like the whole social media thing so we couldn't really get in touch that way either um.. so we kinda lost contact for a while we lost contact for 

74
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,350
[S] quite a long time I think about five years eventually she did contact me again kinda she contact me over Facebook once it had become a thing and we got back in touch and I was like wow

77
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,900
[S] you're still alive that's amazing um.. but yes and we talked a bit kind of we talked about the past, what we're doing currently and stuff like that um.. 

78

80
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:23,775
[S] and there's one thing I did notice that definitely we both had changed quite a lot kind of while she had changed more than I had she was very.. much more mature at this point in time uh..

81
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,925
[S] so we talked but like these messages got shorter and shorter we were very different people we didn't have that much in common anymore um.. so eventually this conversation just kind of 

82
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:29,250
[L] uh-huh
[S] so we talked but like these messages got shorter and shorter we were very different people we didn't have that much in common anymore um.. so eventually this conversation just kind of

[S] so we talked but like these messages got shorter and shorter we were very different people we didn't have that much in common anymore um.. so eventually this conversation just kind of 

84
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:41,525
[S] died out and unfortunately we haven't really talked since then kind of.. so yeah unfortunate hm

85
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,520
