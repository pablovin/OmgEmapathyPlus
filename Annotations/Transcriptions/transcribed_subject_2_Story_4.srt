00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,340
[S] Did you travel somewhere recently?

11

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,510
[S] So, the last week so so?

15
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,650
[L] Three weeks ago or something.

16
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,170
[S] Ah ok. Had any trouble?
[L] Three weeks ago or something.

17
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,880
[S] Ah ok. Had any trouble?

18
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,110
[L] No.
[S] Ah ok. Had any trouble?

19
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,620
[L] No.

20
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,250
[S] Ah ok. That's great.

21
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,110
[S] Um.. I was traveling last week uh..

22
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,050
[S] I had to go to Brussels, which is not that far away, so I could technically take a train

23
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,850
[S] But I've found this deal online on (company name?) and It was a really cheap flight, so I could fly to there.

24
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,680
[S] So i took it. I didn't realize.. I mean I did see that it was in the night, so a night flight

25
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,800
[S] But I didn't realize It was that late, so It was at ten and most of the flights in Europe from airports don't fly at night or (something?)

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:48,820
[S] That was like the last flight or so.
[S] But I didn't realize It was that late, so It was at ten and most of the flights in Europe from airports don't fly at night or (something?)

27
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,080
[S] That was like the last flight or so.

28
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,050
[S] At ten ten PM

29
00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:01,020
[S] Ah.. So I reached the airport and It was dark already and It was.. ah.. pretty stormy because the I think the rain were forecasted or something

30
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,110
[S] And I reached there and there is a huge queue for check in, because apparently a lot of flights were delayed and everything.

31
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,850
[S] Um.. So It took me like almost one hour to get through the check in and everything

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:25,250
[S] (I arrived?) early for the flight but then I realized that I.. while I was checking in there were fifteen to going minutes for me to do the check in, do the security <inaudible> and actually finishing my boarding.

33
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:31,450
[S] By the time I managed to reach the boarding, they were kind of closing It down, but they let me in.

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:40,400
[S] And we boarded the plane.  Um.. So you known Uh.. When you board in some of the airports don`t have the bridges, so you have to get down and the bus takes you to the plane.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
[S] It was one of those um..

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,940
[S] Which already.. I was already started do fell a bit grumpy about it because I don't like that ah..

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:57,220
[S] But when we reached the plane we realized.. or I realized there was a really small plane, you know this propeller small plane with seventy seats or something

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,220
[S] And I hate those.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,250
[S] Because of these propellers I never fell safe on it. I like the jet planes or something a little more secure in my head at least.

40
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,340
[S] Well, It was this propeller plane and at that point I had no option but to just board the plane. so I boarded it and um..

41
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,220
[S] Well, It was this propeller plane and at that point I had no option but to just board the plane. so I boarded it and um..

42
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:25,050
[S] They were hurrying up.. hurrying us up, because the the flight was kind of late <inaudible> we seat on our places <inaudible> as well.

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,710
[S] And then we find out that ah.. the air traffic control didn't allow us..

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,540
[S] the plane to take off because of the storm and everything

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,940
[S] And the other flights waiting to take off before us. So we stand on the tarmac for one hour waiting for a plane to (actually?) stopped

46
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,280
[S] Already going pretty well, It gets worse I tell you.

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,910
[L] Uh
[S] Already going pretty well, It gets worse I tell you.

48
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,970
[S] Um.. After waiting for one hour they don't give us water and they don't switch the air conditioner on the tarmac.
[S] Already going pretty well, It gets worse I tell you.

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,770
[S] Um.. After waiting for one hour they don't give us water and they don't switch the air conditioner on the tarmac.

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,740
[S] It was terrible. We could hardly..

51
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,510
[S] There was not much oxygen left in the plane.

52
00:02:59,510 --> 00:02:59,910
[L] Uh.
[S] There was not much oxygen left in the plane.

53
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,050
[L] Uh.

54
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,110
[S] And suddenly they said ok, now we can go to the take off <inaudible>

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,910
[S] Ah.. we took off ah.. It was a bit shaky the take off as well, the plane was going all over the place and..

56
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,740
[S] Once we reached this cruising altitude um..

57
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,220
[S] Shortly after that, It this.. there was too much turbulence because there was a storm forecasted.

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,680
[S] It was too much turbulence, It was raining heavily, the plane was going from left to right, It was really shaky

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,340
[L] Uh.
[S] It was too much turbulence, It was raining heavily, the plane was going from left to right, It was really shaky

60
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,080
[S] It was too much turbulence, It was raining heavily, the plane was going from left to right, It was really shaky

61
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,200
[S] And the seat belt signs were never switched of we had to keep our seat belts on all the time.

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,250
[S] We couldn't use [inaudible] our seat uh..
[S] And the seat belt signs were never switched of we had to keep our seat belts on all the time.

63
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,770
[S] We couldn't use [inaudible] our seat uh..

64
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,485
[S] And the things get even worse then.

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,457
[S] Suddenly we fell like the air plane is having a fall of one hundred feet or something then

66
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,800
[S] Ah.. You know that feeling when the plane falls and it is just kind of.. 

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,600
[S] I was scared like hell at that part of time because i though I was going to die.

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,685
[S] And then suddenly the lights completely goes off at the plane.

69
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:12,228
[S] Ah.. To my misery, for the fist time in my life I experienced this oxygen masks dropping of. I've never used it before, i never had this experience, so..

70
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,428
[S] And the plane is sort of like free falling almost and I can't breath at that point of time

71
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:25,200
[S] And I can't even put the mask on. I was just shaking with panic at that point. This guy sitting next to me actually helped me to put the mask on.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,971
[S] Then I could breath again, but uh..

73
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,400
[S] For another couple of ten seconds or so we actually felt the plane going down and down. 

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,771
[S] It just felt so.. ah.. scary at that point of time.

75
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:42,314
[S] And because the lights in the plane were completely switched off we could see the lightning flashing outside

76
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,600
[S] This flashes of light coming inside were so scaring like the horror movies or something.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,628
[S] Uh.. A few minutes later It kind of stabilize, the lights came on again. We were told to remove our masks and the plane went to the cruse altitude again. I think there was pretty much we were nearing the destination.
[S] This flashes of light coming inside were so scaring like the horror movies or something.

78
00:04:47,628 --> 00:05:03,333

79
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:11,733
[S] Uh.. But It was really a tough time.  We stand fifteen minutes really (horrifying?). I was completely shaking ah..

80
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:22,133
[S] Even the landing at that point.. The landing was bumping as well, We just bumped twice before we stabilize on the runway.

81
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,666
[S] Ah.. It was like the most (horrifying?) experience in my life having that flight.

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,666
[S] I mean.. I'm glad the pilot was able to hand it, but..

83
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,266
[L] Uh.
[S] I mean.. I'm glad the pilot was able to hand it, but..

84
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,400
[S] I'm never gonna take that flight again. On my way back I've canceled my flight, and I took the train back uh..
[L] Uh.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,200
[S] I'm never gonna take that flight again. On my way back I've canceled my flight, and I took the train back uh..

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,066
[S] It took me more time but I was at least safe, in my head.

87
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:42,133
[S] Probably I'm never gonna take a flight for a short distance again, at least if I know the plane is a small plane, then I'll never take.
[S] It took me more time but I was at least safe, in my head.
