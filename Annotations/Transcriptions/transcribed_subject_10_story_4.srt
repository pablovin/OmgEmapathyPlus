1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
[S] Hey [L] Hi

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,600
[S] How you doing? [L] I'm doing good

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,700
[S] Um I'm telling you, I'll tell you what this real experience that I had

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,900
[S] Do you like traveling by air? [L] Yeah..

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,900
[S] Aren't you scared of it? [L] Little bit

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,680
[S] I'm terrified of traveling by air and and [L] <laughs> okay

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,620
[S] I normally I avoid taking flights if I can [L] Okay

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,500
[S] Um but a couple of weeks ago we were traveling to Zurich

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,320
[S] And um I didn't plan it in advance [L] Uh-huh

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
[S] And the plane takes way too much time to go there

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,520
[S] So I found this really cheap flight on the Zoom last minute deals website [L] Uh-huh, yeah yeah

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,940
[S] And took this flight um it was really cheap [L] Uh-huh

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,980
[S] To and fro was really less than 100 euros

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,620
[L] Uh-huh [S] And I took that flight um..

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,720
[S] I didn't realize it was in the evening, so it was fine for me, I would reach then and go in to the hotel directly but

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,220
[S] It was like the last flight of the day from here right? [L] Okay

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,940
[S] So 9:30, 10pm was the flight from here [L] Okay

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,220
[S] Um so I reach the airport, I reach the airport a couple of hours ago, as I normally do [L] Uh-huh, yeah

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,700
[S] It was a bit rainy evening, like normally it is [L] Uh-huh, okay

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,960
[S] But it was really windy at that night [L] Okay

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,700
[S] So I reach the airport and I see this huge cue of people for check in

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,980
[S] Apparently all the flights before my flight were delayed because of the weather [L] Okay, ah..

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,480
[S] So there was a huge, huge cue for check in, the security was completely packed [L] Uh-huh

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,040
[S] Like the whole airport was completely like stuffed with people at that point in time [L] Okay

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,020
[S] People with flight canceled, delayed, everything happening that night [L] Oh shit, okay

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,840
[S] So even with two hours I just could barely manage to reach the boarding gate in time

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,220
[S] They were closing the gate when I entered [L] Hmm, okay

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,840
[S] They let me in but they were not very happy about it [L] Yeah

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,520
[S] I told them how the check in was really long, and the security was just taking too much time [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,340
[S] And I could just barely manage to get in [L] Okay, uh-huh

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,780
[S] But they allowed me to board the flight, um.. [L] Okay

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,920
[S] You know some of the flights they don't have the bridge to the flight

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,900
[S] So you have to go down and take the bus, and the bus goes to the flight [L] Yeah, yeah, yeah, then take the stairs

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,340
[S] I hate taking that bus, it feels like you are sheep [L] Uh-huh, okay

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,400
[S] And you're being, as a herd of sheep, you're put into this bus [L] <laughs>

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,780
[S] And this bus is gonna take you to the farm and let you go there [L] Yeah <laughs> okay

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,540
[S] But feel like that for me [L] Yeah, okay

38
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,180
[S] Anyway we took, I took the bus, and then um

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,320
[S] As I reach the plane, I see that this is one of those small, really small propel propeller plane plane [L] Ah, okay

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,320
[S] A 60, 70 seater or something [L] Uh-huh, yeah

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,460
[S] And I really hate those planes, there's something with the [L] A lot of turbulence

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,880
[S] A lot of turbulence exactly, and the sound of those blades are basically [L] Yeah, uh-huh

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,440
[S] Too scary for me, feels like it's gonna fall at any time the plane right [L] Okay <laughs> okay

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
[S] It's just so scary for me, uh anyway [L] Uh-huh

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,580
[S] At that time it was too late for me to go anywhere, so I had to take the flight, I said okay fine it's one hour [L] Yeah

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
[L] Yeah, uh-huh [S] Whatever, I'll take the flight

47
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,800
[S] Um so they were rushing us in to board because I think they were getting late or something [L] Yeah

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,520
[S] They just rushed us in, the cruel also not very politely, a bit rude [L] Okay

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,020
[S] And they sort of literally followed us in to go and sit down like [L] That's weird

50
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,700
[S] Because we wanna fly just go quickly and sit down, yeah it was just [L] That's weird, okay

51
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,880
[S] Just really awkward and really really weird what was happening at that point right [L] Yeah, yeah, uh-huh

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
[S] Anyhow, we sit down [L] Hmm

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,180
[S] And then they announce that well the traffic control has told us that we can't fly [L] What?

54
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,180
[S] Because the weather is too bad so we have to wait

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,440
[S] They don't know how long, but we have to wait till the time we're cleared off for take off [L] Okay, okay

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,960
[S] And that I was thinking why the hell were you forcing us.. exactly, right? [L] Pushing us to get into

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,700
[S] If you don't, if you don't, you're not flying there, we're just sitting there for some time [L] <laughs> makes..

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,580
[L] Yeah, like.. yeah [S] Why were you so rude?

59
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,420
[S] They obviously didn't have any answer to that [L] Yeah, miscommunication probably

60
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,980
[S] Yeah.. but they didn't have to be rude to us right? [L] Lack of management.. yeah that's true

61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,880
[S] That was just.. awkward [L] Uh-huh.. uh-huh

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,840
[S] Turns out we were there for one hour in the tarmac waiting for clearance to take off

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
[L] Oh my god [S] One hour we were just sitting there doing nothing

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,700
[L] Oh my god, that's so annoying

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,220
[S] People were cranky, and they don't even switch on the air conditioning or something while you're sitting in [L] <inaudible>

66
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,040
[L] Shit.. oh my god [S] And it was really small, crampy place with 70 people sitting right next to each other

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,920
[S] And I'm claustrophobic and I'm really getting really panicky and fidgety with it [L] Okay.. uh-huh.. okay

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,660
[S] Um.. [L] Isn't it dangerous as well?

69
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,620
[S] I mean it's there, I mean they had very minimal so it was not much oxygen there but it was still fine [L] Uh-huh.. uh-huh

70
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,360
[S] And the boarding gate was still open, so it was okay but it was still not the perfect situation [L] Yeah, okay.. okay, uh-huh.. yeah, okay, uh-huh

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,080
[S] Anyhow, after that one hour, we <inaudible> and we take off

72
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,660
[S] Take off was also shaky, that means the winds were too strong for the plane, the plane was really small [L] Uh-huh.. okay, uh-huh

73
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,760
[S] So it was just going up and down, and by the time we reached the cruising altitude [L] Uh-huh

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,220
[S] We think we can take off the seat belt, go to the lavatory or something, the restroom [L] Uh-huh.. uh-huh

75
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,800
[S] But they said you couldn't take off the seat belts because the plane was going from left to right [L] What the hell

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,180
[S] They didn't allow the lavatories to be used, so we didn't, nobody could go to the lavatory [L] <laughs> such a crazy experience

77
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,000
[S] It was like everything was going wrong in that experience, right? [L] Okay.. okay.. uh-huh

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,020
[S] And then it gets worse, suddenly the lights go off [L] Oh my god.. what?

79
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,760
[S] Apparently there was some turbulence, there was some fall, the light goes off

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,520
[S] And we're seeing this lightning outside, because it was raining [L] Oh my god

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,980
[S] Flashes of light coming in, like a picture from a horror movie

82
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,200
[S] A scene from a horror movie [L] Oh my good, do you start thinking it's gonna crash

83
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,840
[S] And and you can't move, you've been told not to get up [L] Shit.. uh-huh 

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,800
[S] You can't go to the lavatory, the plane is just shaking terribly [L] Oh my god

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,940
[S] Um you know when sometimes turbulence happens, the plane goes up and then suddenly has a fall [L] Yeah, yeah, yeah

86
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,820
[S] And you feel like it's gonna fall out [L] Yeah, that's true, oh my god

87
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,720
[S] Normally it's like for one or two seconds, right? But this was like 30 seconds of just falling [L] Uh-huh

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,220
[S] It felt like the plane fell like 400 feet or something [L] Oh my god

89
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,780
[S] And I'm panicking at that point, right? This is way.. they're like... [L] <laughs>

90
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,200
[S] Everything worse that I can imagine about this flight experience is getting, is coming true [L] Is going, oh my god, okay

91
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,760
[S] The worst, worst experience [L] Uh-huh

92
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,480
[S] And then the oxygen masks follow [L] Oh my god, shit

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,660
[S] You always think that well, this will never happen

94
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,760
[S] They tell you about it when you're boarding but this never happens right? [L] Yeah, but

95
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,860
[S] An that was the first time it actually happened to me [L] Uh-huh.. okay

96
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,060
[S] And I didn't know what to do with it, because I could not put it on er

97
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,240
[S] Because I was panicking, everything was shaking [L] Yeah, exactly

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,740
[S] The guy sitting next to me actually helped me put on the mask, so I could breathe again

99
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,800
[S] But then again, this plane was again falling and trying to climb up [L] Uh-huh.. oh my god, shit

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,560
[S] Falling, trying to climb up

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,020
[S] And I, I was thinking okay this is the last light of my life

102
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,020
[L] Oh my god, shit [S] And I'm gonna die

103
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,020
[S] This is gonna crash and everything is gonna burn to hell now [L] Oh my god

104
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,660
[S] Er this goes on for the next 20 minutes you know?

105
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,960
[S] The, the goes up, falls down, goes up, falls down [L] Oh my god, like, oh shit

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,220
[S] By the end of that 20 minutes they kind of stabilized, probably we moved out of the bad weather area [L] Uh-huh

107
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,440
[S] Closing down on where we had to go.. the destination

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
[S] I went, everybody was annoyed with the crew, so we were told we can take off the mask

109
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,880
[S] The light came back on again [L] Yeah.. okay

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,660
[S] They served us some water and everything, and everybody was shouting at the crew [L] Thank god.. uh-huh

111
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,320
[S] But what could they do right? The weather was that bad.. um.. [L] Yeah.. uh-huh

112
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,140
[S] Just, just a harrowing experience, really, really scary [L] Oh my god.. uh-huh

113
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,860
[S] Um then we started to descend for landing, even the landing was weird [L] Really?

114
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,420
[S] Cause we landed and we jumped twice on the runway before we actually landed [L] Oh my god

115
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,740
[S] Um.. I [L] You're lucky the plane didn't explode or something, but

116
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,240
[S] That could be the next thing, the next worse thing would happen, we don't even land, we just burst into flames [L] <laughs> yes.. yeah.. uh-huh

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,060
[S] I mean people were really annoyed at the pilot, but I think well what could he do? [L] Uh-huh

118
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,640
[S] The, the weather was that bad. Yeah, landing was his fault <laughs> [L] Yeah

119
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,620
[L] Yeah, come on, okay.. yeah [S] Other than, other than that he was probably not a very skilled pilot or something

120
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
[S] Just the plane is too light [L] That's a really scary experience

121
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,380
[S] I was so scared, I canceled my flight back, I took the train [L] <laughs>

122
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,060
[S] Um I couldn't, probably is gonna be the same flight, and I wouldn't want to go through the same experience again [L] Yeah

123
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,000
[L] Yeah, of course, this is so bad [S] Yeah, and

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,880
[S] Yeah, it scared me for life now, I'm very scared of taking flights already [L] Uh-huh.. uh-huh.. <laughs>

125
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,840
[S] Now, now I'm even petrified of them now, taking it [L] Yeah.. yeah, I can understand

126
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,500
[S] I probably make sure, even if I have to fly, I don't take the night flights
