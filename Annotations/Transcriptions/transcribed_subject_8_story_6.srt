00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,620
[L] No

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,900

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,680

[L] A little in New Zealand but not in Columbia like never on this continent.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,440
[S] Okay. It's an amazing feeling. Ah, the thing is they have the forest, they have some tracks around the forest that you could go and walk around and so. 

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,480
[S] But it was the rainy season and then they say yeah, don't go there. It's dangerous.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,200
[L] Hmm.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:01,620
[S] And you know maybe it's raining then you got lost and you..we have to go out and search for you. Something like that. Ah.. but whatever I decided to go.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,440
[S] And I packed some food, packed some water and just went to the..to the..to the track around the..the forest. 

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,100
[S] And..I don't know, the experience of being inside such a forest is amazing. 

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:21,440
[S] The colors, the illumination of the..it's completely dense right but there is this sunlights coming in and illuminating this..

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,140
[S] this trees, this plant, this leaves, the flowers.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,680
[L] Hmm.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,600
[S] The sounds. The, the, the sounds of the monkeys, faraway, of the birds, of the, you know, the smell, it's such a..

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,880
[S] I don't know it is overwhelming experience. Really, really heavy on you and I was just experiencing this really loving it, walking around.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,280
[S] I think I walked for two three hours, just ah on the forest. Then it started to rain. And then came this tropical rain

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,100
[L] Oh..

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,760
S] Really, really like the..the sky is falling on your head. The raindrops was like this size

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,180
[L] <agrees>

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,360
[S] Was really, really dense. Really, two seconds and I was completely soaked. 

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,000
[S] So I was like I cannot stay like that I'll get sick. So I was looking..runaway..looking for shelter. 

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,500
[S] Then I saw a trunk of a tree and I said yeah okay I would stay behind this trunk and protect myself of the rain. 

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,460
[S] I mean usually they say that the rain lasts one-two hours everyday so

35
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,060
[L] <agrees>

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,980
[S] Wait there for one-two hours and then I go out. Sitted there, waited a bit. Was really experiencing also the rain, it's really heavy. 

37
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:29,080
[S] Really everything changed on the forest, everything is quiet. This very, very heavy ah rain sounds and smell.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:38,140
[S] And suddenly I hear something moving around me and then I look up and then I saw that the tree was moving around. Like, yeah, what that's weird.

39
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,520
[L] Hmm.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:49,220
[S] I'm that tired now? That's really strange. While I was wondering, ah behind the tree came a head of a huge anaconda. 

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,060
[S] Was so, so, so big.

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,720
[L] Oh my God!

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,880
[S] Completely like, completely scream out loud..I

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,260
[L] Yeah

45
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,380
[S] throw myself on the ground, running away from the tree. Completely soaked, but screaming, screaming, screaming.

46
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:08,820
[S] For some luck, the snake I don't think it saw me, it paid no attention to me. But I was so scared. 

47
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,020
[S] I run away in the rain, found the track, run away back to the village

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,540
[L] <laughs>

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,900
[S] Lock myself. Lock the door. Lock the windows and was in the bed like shaking like that

50
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,460
[L] Enough nature

51
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,960
[S] Completely enough nature for me. I was completely scared. Completely, completely. 

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:34,200
[S] And I never was afraid of snakes but since that moment I..every time I'm on a place with (food?) or so I'm always looking around and wow

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,080
[L] <laughs>

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,740
[S] It was such a traumatizing experience. It was really, really something.
