Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Okay, great where were we before we were interrupted..uh..hmm..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.72,0:00:11.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Okay <laughs> so after my friend left for Asia..just a week after she had left I was bit down in the dumps kind of I didn’t really..I..<inaudible> 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.80,0:00:20.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] it’s just <inaudible> I was friend and he has a kind of way to distract myself in some sense ah..so I started to get a little into music..kind of, ah..do you like music?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.54,0:00:22.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yeah, I love music.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.34,0:00:29.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] ah, very good <breath> cause, i got really into music, kinda and I really wanted my parents to buy me an instrument kind of like a guitar or something
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.24,0:00:35.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] so it kind of ah..kind of <laughs> get my..get it out..kinda get it out of my system 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.24,0:00:43.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] ah..my parents viewed it more as a kind of phase essentially which is something I was going for, so they did kind of ignore me in then some regard to a large extent
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.00,0:00:49.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] kind of they just thought it would pass but <breath> but I just kept nagging them so it was like..<laughs> it became a bit of a balance there
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.66,0:00:58.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The closest I could get was eventually I convinced them to send me to a music oriented high school kind of once I had graduated from middle school essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.46,0:01:09.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] so essentially they allowed me to go to this kind of more..with ah..a high school with a more emphasis on music, if I..could also go and attend like normal, real classes there kinda <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.08,0:01:14.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and not just these weird musical classes. And that worked great kind of. This was very nice. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.80,0:01:25.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I had a lot of fun there, the food was good, a bit <inaudible> uh <laughs> uh..so..yeah I know really enjoyed going to school there.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.30,0:01:31.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] but there was a one thing I..one problem..one major problem I had with that school, there was this one mandatory course, called ah classical music theory
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.88,0:01:32.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <agrees>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.56,0:01:40.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and, the problem with this course was I <inaudible>..I am pretty sure the teacher was like a kind of demon in the shape of a human kind of. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.96,0:01:48.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was pretty awful. She used to really yell at students and belittle them like drag students around by the ear and stuff, it was pretty bad. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.16,0:01:48.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <agrees>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.58,0:01:53.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah..and I really did..did not like this teacher <laughs>. She was pretty awful.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.06,0:01:59.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah the good thing was that..I actually met a couple of people like me and some more students who took her class and I essentially bonded with these four guys kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.44,0:02:05.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We just hating this particular teacher because she was just such an awful human being, kind of <laughs>. Ah..which was interesting <laughs>. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.92,0:02:10.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But, yeah, and that continued on for about a year, I went to this school, kind of I really enjoyed myself. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.68,0:02:19.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] After one year essentially we had to give this presentation on Classical music theory in front of the entire class and I was very nervous about this. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.54,0:02:26.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I was still very shy and uh shy kind of as a person at that point and so partially just having to present in front of the entire class was a problem
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.16,0:02:32.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and then the fact that I had to present in front of this teacher was which I was just terrified of <inaudible>..she was just evil <laughs>. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.32,0:02:36.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah..so I did spend a lot of time like practicing and preparing for this and I rehearsed and I kind of..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.64,0:02:36.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <agrees>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.94,0:02:42.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Well I felt fairly confident so I went up and I gave the presentation and people laughed and they, you know, applauded once I was done. 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.56,0:02:48.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I thought I had done a really good job and uh..but once I done the teacher really like laid in to my presentation like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.12,0:02:53.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] “No, this was wrong! Why did you say this? You can’t mean this. Why did you do this? <inaudible> Can you just speak louder?” it’s like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.02,0:03:01.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and I was really like distraught after this kind of cause I was a very fragile person so I actually had to go like <laughs> I basically cried essentially 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.12,0:03:06.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and I went back home and told my parents like - “Look I can’t deal with this..kind of..this is too much for me.” 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.46,0:03:10.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um..so we had to go have a talk with the school kind of and see if we could do anything about it. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.90,0:03:15.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But like the school said that basically - “she’s on a bunch of boards. We can’t get rid of her. So she’s basically there to stay”. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.24,0:03:21.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh..and I couldn’t just deal with her anymore because like it was a mandatory course, sure, but I couldn’t handle her for another two years..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.88,0:03:30.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] uh..so eventually we discussed..like um..we decided to send me to..like this musical high school shared a lot of courses with a normal high school essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.02,0:03:34.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] so i could transfer over to the normal high school, without like it impacting my studies too much. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.78,0:03:39.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And my parents were also happy I was back to a more technical <laughs> subject as well so uh..yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.54,0:03:48.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I eventually went to the normal high school and finished my curriculum there. It was a shame I couldn’t finish at the musical school, but <shrugs> <laughs>. Life <laughs>.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.40,0:03:54.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah um I did actually meet up with one of the guys that I went to the musical school when I went to college essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.14,0:03:58.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] so once I went to college I met up with..I..all five of them. It went quite well. The guys were in the corridor..I said “hey, how are you doing?” 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.90,0:04:05.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we talked a bit <inaudible> said “Ah, we’re still playing in this band kind of..uh..with these other four guys”..I had <inaudble> to earlier on. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.46,0:04:13.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then he said like “ah you should join us sometime. It would be fun!” <shrugs> it’s like “ah..yeah, yeah. I remember you are good at singing ”. Like really? um, okay <laughs>. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.96,0:04:23.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I actually uh..sing for them essentially as a vocalist. I did sing, and we played there and we practiced a bit kind of and eventually we arranged to have a bit of a like concert for..um 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.24,0:04:28.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] some of our friends..and um..close friends and stuff and it’s like..no, it was a really good experience. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.62,0:04:33.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause like when we had that concert I really felt like I was alive kinda I really felt like I was on cloud nine. It was a great experience. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.22,0:04:41.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah..yeah so that was..yeah..so that’s how I kind of got to sing in the band and still keep in touch with them <laughs>.
