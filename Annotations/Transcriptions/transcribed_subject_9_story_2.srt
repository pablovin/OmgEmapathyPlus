1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
[S] So where were we before we were interrupted, it's a really um, right

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,440
[S] So my friend left essentially um [L] Uh-huh

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,040
[S] And this can be pretty hard kind of, I was in a pretty, I was pretty lonely once again kind of

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,920
[S] Cause she was a very close friend of mine, everyone else was a bit more out there so it's like

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,500
[S] How long have you spent with her? 7 months? [L] <inaudible>.. about seven months, kind of

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,280
[S] So it took a while for me to kind of get over that

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,800
[S] I did actually start to look for some way to kind of cope with that essentially um

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,260
[S] So I started to look a lot into music kind of, and look a lot into kind of

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,440
[S] Perhaps going to play some instrument as to kind of vent in some sense essentially

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,140
[S] Were you doing that time, like studying the language?

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,780
[S] Ah.. studying the language and going to normal school, cause I, cause I spoke English

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,920
[S] I can go to normal school with the other kids basically, cause I just <laughs> spoke English [L] Uh-huh.. uh-huh

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,200
[S] So that was a good uh a good thing for me um..

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,900
[S] Yeah but.. basically so I started to look a lot into music kind of

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,200
[S] Very, you know, got into this you're going to be a musician essentially

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,500
[S] It just kind of, I don't know, it just felt like it would be a good idea

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,060
[S] I know I was a kid, I don't know what I was thinking but <laughs> [L] Yeah <laughs>

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,860
[S] Uh so I nagged my parents a lot, like I want a guitar, or like I want a piano or something

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,000
[S] I tried to convince them about them, they weren't too into it [L] Uh-huh 

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,160
[S] They just treated it like a phase that thought I would get over eventually kind of thing [L] <laughs>

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,400
[S] I kept nagging them but they never really let up er..

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,780
[S] The closest I got to convincing them was that

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,140
[S] That when I was going to transfer between a (local?) middle school to like high school [L] Hmm

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,280
[S] They let me go to a kind of more music oriented high school

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,580
[S] If the high school actually gave like maths and science and like real courses

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,280
[S] Instead of just the weird music courses <laughs> [L] Uh-huh like a plan b

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,740
[S] Like a plan b exactly ah yeah [L] <laughs>

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,020
[S] So they agreed to that, I kind of started at this school

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,660
[S] It was a very nice school, um it was a very

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,280
[S] Er I learned a lot while I was there, very nice campus

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,440
[S] The food was a bit better than here uh you know <laughs> [L] <laughs>

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,240
[S] Ah it was a, it was a very, it was a very nice ah school in general 

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,940
[S] I really enjoyed my time while I was there

34
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,480
[S] But we'll get to that, there's one course I had a problem with, one mandatory course

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,440
[S] And that course was called classical music theory [L] Hmm

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,840
[S] Uh and the issue I had with this course was that there was this teacher

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,560
[S] And I, she really must have been a demon in the shape of a human being kind of thing cause [L] <laughs>

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,320
[S] She was just really bad, she yelled at the kids a lot

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,580
[S] She.. and she used to like take kids by the ear and drag them around the classroom and stuff like that [L] <laughs>

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,840
[S] It was pretty awful to ever have to be in her class kind of [L] <laughs>

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,620
[S] She was a really just like, terrible, terrible person [L] <laughs>

42
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,180
[S] And she really made my life hell <inaudible> (during?) this course, it was pretty bad [L] <laughs>

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,200
[S] Um me and, I actually met some friends, just like

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,780
[S] Me and these 4 other guys like used to bond over just hating this one teacher essentially [L] <laughs>

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,680
[S] Cause like she was so awful that we would sit and talk about how awful she was after class

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,660
[L] Uh-huh [S] Um so I made some friends there at the school, which was nice

47
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,660
[S] Just through this teacher essentially

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,640
[S] And for the most part the school was okay

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,160
[S] Except for this one course that really like made my life awful kind of <laughs> [L] <laughs>

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,860
[S] Uh and this continued for about a year kind of

51
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,020
[S] Uh and then after one year we had to give this very big presentation

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,080
[S] In this like uh what's uh classical music theory course [L] Uh-huh

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,880
[S] Um [L] Are you playing anything in that time?

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,320
[S] Uh yeah I played a quite, I played a decent amount, I learned a lot

55
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,980
[S] Um it was a lot of just normal school classes essentially 

56
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,640
[S] I only had these music classes like an extra curricular thing like

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
[S] When you, sometimes you would have, other people wuld have sports, we would have music essentially [L] Uh-huh

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,480
[S] Um.. yeah and so I had to give this one presentation essentially

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,940
[S] To the class, in classical music theory, and..

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,100
[S] I was super nervous, cause I was still very shy at this point in time in some sense [L] Uh-huh

61
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,300
[S] Ah.. but on the, cause on the one hand I had to like present everything to the entire class

62
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,100
[S] Which is like scary enough to actually speak in front of a group of people

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,060
[S] And then on the other hand I was terrified of this teacher, so like <laughs> [L] Uh-huh

64
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,460
[S] I was really scared of like what she would say about my presentation and stuff er

65
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,160
[S] So I did prepare a lot for this presentation, I prepared slides, I practiced in front of my mirror and stuff like that [L] Hmm

66
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,840
[S] Ah and then I finally gave this presentation kind of

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,620
[S] Um and I thought the presentation went well

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,880
[S] Uh I presented it to the class kind of and they all laughed throughout mostly in the presentation

69
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,980
[S] They clapped when I was done, I felt pretty good about it

70
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,140
[S] But then when I was done this teacher really ripped into like my, what's it called, presentation kind of

71
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,180
[S] She really like said no why would say this, why did you do this, this was entirely wrong kind of thing [L] Hmm

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,380
[S] And she really just like was very mean and like uh..

73
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,380
[S] Mean about it, like the feedback she gave essentially [L] Uh-huh

74
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,400
[S] Uh and that kind of really uh really impacted my self esteem kind of

75
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,100
[S] Because I'm a very fra, I was a very fragile person back <inaudible> [L] Negatively

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,860
[S] Yeah, it very negatively impacted my self esteem kind of, cause I was a very fragile back then

77
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,200
[S] As a person I had very low self esteem still at that time

78
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,760
[S] So it was very difficult for me to handle that kind of negative unfiltered feedback kind of

79
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,000
[S] Uh so I basically returned to my parents in tears kind of <laughs>

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,280
[S] And told them like look uh this is just not working like I can't deal with this teacher, I don't want to

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,980
[S] Uh so  we went and talked with the school, but the school said they can't really do anything like

82
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,500
[S] This lady, she, they'd had reports about her before

83
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,800
[S] But she's on a bunch of boards and she couldn't really be replaced that easily kind of

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,040
[S] And it was up to her how she uh her class and stuff [L] Hmm

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,640
[S] So we couldn't really deal much about that

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,180
[S] But the course was still mandatory so it's like

87
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,400
[S] She'd still be around kind of, and she made people's life difficult anyway, even when they weren't in her class

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,200
[S] So we discussed possibly like just

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,140
[S] Uh cause we had, they were, the normal high school also shared a couple of courses with this uh music school

90
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
[S] So they suggested that we could transfer

91
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,660
[S] What was left of my education over to this normal high school kind of

92
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,160
[S] And I could just go back to a more technical like oriented thing

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,000
[S] Where I wouldn't have to do these music courses with her [L] Hmm

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,940
[S] Ah which was okay, it was a solution kind of

95
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,000
[S] Which we took uh, it wasn't, it would've been better if I could've con

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,340
[S] Or I would've been happier if I could've continued with the music place

97
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,560
[S] But my parents were just happy that I can switch to a technical, you know, school kind of

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,340
[S] My parents are very practical like that so <laughs> [L] Hmm

99
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,280
[S] Ah it was unfortunate but I did eventually finish off kind of

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,300
[S] Graduating with this kind of more technical degree in high school

101
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,460
[S] Um.. yeah I didn't really pursue music too much [L] But you gave up about finding

102
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,040
[S] It was a bit of a traumatic experience kind of

103
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,980
[S] So it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth kind of for a very long time [L] Hmm

104
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,300
[S] Uh eventually I had to go to college after this kind of uh..

105
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,420
[S] And I, the weird thing is I actually did bump into one of those people I'd been in a band back at this music school

106
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,920
[S] Who, and they still hated the teacher by the way, cause they'd actually been there for the last two years

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,600
[S] Had to deal with the teacher the last, last two years [L] <laughs>

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,760
[S] Ah but we start talking a lot, and talking about how things were

109
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,980
[S] And he said that he and the other guys had started up a band

110
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,060
[S] And they play a bit casually every now and then kind of

111
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,680
[S] And he said that hey yeah you should us. I was like, what? Me? <laughs>

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,200
[S] I was like really? <laughs> cause like I didn't like [L] <laughs>

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,840
[S] Wow I was like wow <laughs> I'm surprised you were even like remember that I exist

114
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,140
[S] Like yeah you were a good vocalist, and like uh wow okay

115
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,280
[L] <laughs> [S] Ah so <laughs> so I joined them and we like rehearsed a bit

116
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
[S] And we try out some stuff and it was really fun and

117
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,740
[S] And eventually we actually had, have like a small concert, or a small concert for like uh

118
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,020
[S] Some friends and stuff, a group of friends and like

119
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,900
[S] It went very well, and I felt really like liberated and free and I got to do the performance kind of stuff

120
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,180
[S] It was really cool, I really felt amazing [L] Uh-huh

121
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,680
[S] It really helped my self uh, self esteem quite a lot so <laughs>

122
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,360
[S] Yeah that was a good experience for me [L] Hmm

123
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
[L] Cool, fantastic [S] Ah yeah
