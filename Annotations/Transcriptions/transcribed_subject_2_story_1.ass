Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.25,0:02:18.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and what we would do with this thing is that we would take it to like the top of a hill essentially.. so we took it to the top of a hill and then we would kind of roll it down <inaudible> this hill and was right next to it it was this kind of asphalted like hill right
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.55,0:02:24.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[L[ hm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.22,0:02:28.57,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] right next to my house kind of thing and so we would do this a couple of times doesn't sound very safe does it? <laughs> kids (get up?) to stupid things I'm telling you <laughs> yeah so yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.57,0:02:37.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] this time actually like what happened like we played with this thing quite a lot but eventually one day what happened was we walked to the top of this hill and then normally we just kind of let it roll down 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.02,0:02:47.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] but then <inaudible> time I was sitting in it and she was (right?) behind me she gave me a big push kind of down the hill to make it go faster and this didn't go too well I was kind of holding on for dear life and then kind of I swung it a bit 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.50,0:02:56.45,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] too far just holding on just with my body weight and then it kind of flipped over and I was still stuck in this thing kind of so like the thing flipped over and I was like stuck in it and then like 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.72,0:02:58.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] hm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.45,0:03:05.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] so what happens is I landed <inaudible> on my side right and I scraped my side all the way the like.. before a couple of like feet essentially down this hill kind of and I was just 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.42,0:03:13.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] a big bloody mess during this time it was pretty bad and it got so.. it was.. there was all the blood she was screaming she had to run and get my dad kinda because I was just
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.92,0:03:23.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] lying there like screaming and like crying it was not great yeah it wasn't nice um.. yeah but that was great fun kind of stuff like that you remember the stupid

Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.52,0:03:32.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] things you do as kid right? um.. yeah and I had great fun with her kinda she was my first real friend kind of when I got to Sweden which is 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.90,0:03:42.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] cool to be friends with a cute girl <laughs> uh.. yeah so that continued for a while me and her had a lot of fun but eventually I found out 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.55,0:03:51.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] that she would be moving her family or her dad more specifically had gotten a job in Asia kind of and that she had obviously move there for work

Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.12,0:04:00.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] kind of because you go where you.. you go where you get paid and so we decided to try to keep in touch kinda we <inaudible> exchange numbers and stuff but that didn't really work out 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.62,0:04:07.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] too well 'cause we're kids we're stupid this was a (trip?) before Facebook like way back when the age when we were using messenger and stuff (and that?)
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.72,0:04:18.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <laughs> doesn't always work right when you have to move kind of that far away so eventually we lost touch and like I became really sad I was really lonely again kinda I really reverted
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.37,0:04:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] back um.. which is unfortunate.. for me at least and I got over it eventually with quite a long time (perhaps?) but.. 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.90,0:04:36.57,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] but she did get in touch later on kinda of I think it was about when was it five years later I think when she got back in touch with me <inaudible> she reached out and I was kind of
