Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.20,0:03:25.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] (after?) all the features we added <laughs> uh.. but uh.. so one day I did actually get pretty hurt like uh.. riding this thing so what we were doing was <inaudible> say we took it to the top of the hill someone sit
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.17,0:03:35.25,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and we let it roll it down kinda and one day we took it to the top of the hill I sat in the go kart and then what would happen is she actually 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.25,0:03:41.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] my friend actually she really pushed me very hard down the hill and then it was going down the hill like really fast
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.20,0:03:42.47,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] ok and then it tilted or?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.47,0:03:51.87,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah it tilted, curved and then tilted kind of over and I was still in the track 'cause my leg was still in the.. in the kart I couldn't really get my legs out kinda so I had to brace with the right side of my body 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.10,0:04:02.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] essentially so I landed on like the asphalt and I kinda of skied the couple of feet I really tore up my arm kind there was a lot of skin there was a lot of blood it was pretty.. it was
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.12,0:04:11.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] pretty bad um.. I was just screaming I was a mess kind of <laughs> I was screaming and crying and bleeding and she was screaming and crying and she had to run off 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.90,0:04:22.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and get my dad kind of like pick me up 'cause he was (out?) in the backyard working uh.. <laughs> it was a traumatic experience and needless to say the go kart got 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.02,0:04:23.67,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] thrown out after that <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.72,0:04:26.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] yeah of course and your parent must've been <inaudible> out of that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.20,0:03:41.45,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.50,0:04:36.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah they didn't enjoy.. they didn't think it was a good.. they weren't happy with me doing that uh.. but I don't really regret it was obviously a very stupid idea but that's the
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.22,0:04:38.67,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] kind of stuff that you remember as you get older 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.32,0:04:41.07,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah that's true we do stupid sh.. stuff 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.42,0:04:40.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah it's the kind of 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.12,0:04:43.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah <laughs> stupid stuff uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.20,0:04:45.45,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] as we're growing up.. yeah it's funny <inaudible> not doing that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.45,0:04:55.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah <inaudible>.. exactly.. something you can tell your grand kinds kind of thing <laughs> yeah but uh.. yeah so that was some of the stuff that we got up to and I really enjoyed spending time with this girl 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.40,0:05:04.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] uh.. it sadly didn't last for that long unfortunately because after about.. I'd know her for about six or seven months at that point in time 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.20,0:05:14.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] uh.. she told me that her family was moving away to Asia her dad had gotten a job essentially so she was going to move and this was a bit of a shock for me obviously 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.02,0:05:24.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] because I just met this uh.. new friend kind it's very <laughs> it makes you very.. yeah you're with a low self esteem right? you're already a bit scared and fragile right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.02,0:05:33.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and then someone like that was very important kind of just disappears this anchor in this new place it's kinda this rock that you've clung to it like disappeared 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.62,0:05:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and you have to kinda deal with that, that was very difficult for me as a child kind of I felt like very alone and a bit abandoned maybe we did exchange phone numbers to try to keep in touch 'cause
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.00,0:05:54.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] this was bit before social media and stuff uh.. but when I tried to call her when she got in there she didn't like apparently she couldn't answer apparently Swedish SIM cards didn't work that well in
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.17,0:06:04.25,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Asia kind of thing um.. so we lost contact for a while kind of uh.. for about five years I think.. eventually yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.25,0:06:13.47,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] it's a pretty long time she did get in contact five years later via Facebook I was pretty surprised.. Yeah I was pretty surprised when she showed up <inaudible> because uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.47,0:06:23.47,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah.. I mean I think it's just kind of a whim kinda she was connecting to people and she saw me as a suggestion like ah this guy and I was pretty surprised when I got a message from her it was like wow you still exist
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.47,0:06:33.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] it's amazing kind of thing uh.. so we chatted for a while we talked about who we were what we were doing at the moment like old stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.12,0:06:40.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] we talked for a while but I eventually (realized?) she changed quite a lot as a person and I guess so did I right it's been five years 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.60,0:06:42.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] yeah of course and she traveled and stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.60,0:06:52.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah she traveled and stuff so she obviously been.. she changed a lot and I changed a lot so the conversation it started of like fairly enthusiastic but as time went on It kind of like <inaudible> out
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.97,0:07:02.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and then towards the end it really like.. there were very short responses and like she wasn't very enthusiastic uh.. and after while we just kind of stopped talking which is a shame
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.40,0:07:08.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and I haven't really heard from her since then but I guess it's part of growing up and people change essentially is that people change and you..
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.97,0:07:10.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] lose touch with them
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.55,0:07:18.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah.. yeah yeah precisely
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.02,0:07:22.25,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <inaudible> <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.45,0:07:27.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] hm ..yeah definitely definitely <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.97,0:07:19.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] I think so too I think separate sections of life have separate relationships and as you're evolving then the relationships are also evolving with you so.. so it makes 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.40,0:07:26.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] kind of sense <laughs> I think only really really close friends really stick by but really less numbered 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.62,0:07:28.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yeah <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.62,0:07:30.62,Default,,0,0,0,,
