Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.18,0:01:52.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] One thing I didn't like on school, is there was this one course
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.20,0:01:54.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was called classical music theory [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.72,0:01:58.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the reason I didn't like this course, there was this one teacher that we had and she was just..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.42,0:02:00.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] A really bad person, she was pretty awful
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.36,0:02:03.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was like a demon in the shape of a human kind of <laughs> [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.68,0:02:06.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um and she used to be like, she used to yell a lot at students [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.92,0:02:09.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Sometimes she used to like drag students by their ears kind of [L] Hmm.. hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.40,0:02:13.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like bordering on like slightly abusive, a bit on the abusive side, which isn't great
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.66,0:02:16.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh that's not good.. yeah, yeah [S] No, it's not good
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.32,0:02:20.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yeah [S] Um.. and I actually did, I actually meet friends kind of, we went to the same, we went to the same class
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.76,0:02:24.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That she was holding kind of, so we kind of bonded over hating this one particular teacher kind of [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.74,0:02:26.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was so awful [L] Yeah, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.48,0:02:30.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. so yeah, but otherwise I, yeah I spent a lot of time with them
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.14,0:02:32.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I like really enjoyed going to that school um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.70,0:02:36.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I continued for about one year into the school term kind of [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.42,0:02:38.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and then we were supposed to..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.76,0:02:41.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I wasn't, wasn't at the school for my entire school thing, and I'm gonna tell you why
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.84,0:02:46.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because essentially after one year we had to give this presentation in classical music theory
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.86,0:02:50.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This is a mandatory course, so you know that you get your grade in your final exam [L] Ah, okay.. yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.90,0:02:54.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You need to do this mandatory like classical music course [L] Okay, yeah, yeah, yea
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.60,0:02:58.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And there was this big presentation we were supposed to do in front of the class and everyone
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.06,0:02:59.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And in front of this teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.64,0:03:03.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I was terrified of doing this presentation, like it was, it was ah [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.12,0:03:07.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was, it was very uncomfortable kind of, partially I'm not, I wasn't a very outgoing person back then [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.44,0:03:11.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I've become more outgoing over time, I don't know if you've noticed <laughs> um [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.58,0:03:13.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But uh I wasn't very outgoing back then
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.82,0:03:17.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But now I'm er well like so it was stressful for me
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.76,0:03:20.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah and also I had to give in front of this teacher kind of [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.92,0:03:24.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Who was like my nightmare kind of turned into a real person [L] Yeah. yeah, your, your demon
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.54,0:03:27.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, my, my own personal demon in some sense ah.. [L] <laughs> yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.80,0:03:32.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I prepared a lot for this, and I prepared slides, prepared to the talk and like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.20,0:03:36.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Well I, I, when, the day, the day the presentation came, I gave the presentation [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.06,0:03:39.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I thought I pretty well, I was pretty happy with it, people applauded, but then like [L] Uh-huh, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.82,0:03:43.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As soon as I was done like the teacher really started ripping into my presentation, it's like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.04,0:03:46.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And this was wrong, this was awful, why did you say this, this was just not right
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.26,0:03:50.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And like I.. really, it was a really hard blow kind of [L] Sure
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.04,0:03:53.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I was a little bit, I wasn't such a confident person to start with, kind of [L] Sure, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.22,0:03:57.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it's like the fact that she kind of would rip into something that I'd done made me feel really bad [L] Yeah, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.48,0:04:01.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <inaudible> yeah [S] <laughs> so I just went home to my parents and I was like a wreck kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.96,0:04:06.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like I told them like, look this is what happened, I'm really unhappy, can I go do something about this [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.80,0:04:11.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh [S] Um.. yeah so my parents came and we talked to the school about it
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.34,0:04:13.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh [S] And then like we saw if we could do something about the teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.34,0:04:15.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then the school said no, basically the teacher is here to stay kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.82,0:04:20.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We can't do anything to get rid of them kind of thing, so I was really uncomfortable [L] <laughs> oh, of course she can be (creepy?) that way
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.18,0:04:23.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, I mean, sometimes it's like, you need uh, with certain people
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.06,0:04:28.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause she was very important, she was on some boards, or some direction, or something like that, so I was very unfortunate [L] Okay.. okay.. okay
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.84,0:04:31.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh [S] So we couldn't really get rid of her kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.56,0:04:35.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and this course was mandatory, and I just really didn't want to go this course with this person [L] Oh that's very sad
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.68,0:04:40.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so we talked a bit and we came to the conclusion that we would still be okay if I kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.32,0:04:43.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The thing we could do, because the normal high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.34,0:04:47.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Had a lot of courses shared with this music school, so that I could transfer to this normal high school kind of [L] Yeah, okay
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.64,0:04:52.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then just keep going.. um and finish my school curriculum there kind of [L] Okay.. wow
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.26,0:04:55.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Okay [S] Which was I thought like, sure as long as I get to avoid this person
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.28,0:04:57.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause like I don't, I can't handle this kind of [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.28,0:05:02.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Cause you are intimidated by, by her [S] Yeah I was a very, I was a very fragile person, I'd say, back then kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.04,0:05:05.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it wasn't great for me to have to deal with that kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.16,0:05:09.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Especially because you look up to people in positions of, in like this kind of, er.. [L] Yeah, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.58,0:05:11.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Teaching positions essentially, and so it's like [L] Yeah, sure
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.68,0:05:15.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] When you, any criticism from them becomes very hurtful kind of [L] Uh-huh.. yeah, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.62,0:05:22.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so I did eventually swap over to and complete my high school curriculum in this high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.22,0:05:27.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And yeah it was a shame I had to leave but it was a lot less stressful when I transferred over to the normal school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.30,0:05:30.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I, I missed out on some friends, but I made some new friends as well, so that was <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.88,0:05:35.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] A bit of a shame but fine for me kind of er.. [L] But that's good I mean, you have supportive parents
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.76,0:05:39.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah my parents have been very supportive along the way kind of, so yeah, always [L] Yeah, yeah 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.52,0:05:44.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they were also pretty, they were probably pretty happy that I was transferred over to a more technical school as well [L] Yeah <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.20,0:05:46.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Kind of to be honest but [L] <laughs> yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.20,0:05:48.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] But uh in a new environment for you to start
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.20,0:05:52.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, new and, new and more stable environment for me kind of er, which was good [L] Yeah.. yeah, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.64,0:05:56.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I did eventually graduate from high school, I went to college er..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.98,0:06:00.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] In a more, in a technical thing, in a more technical thing kind of [L] Uh-huh, uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.64,0:06:02.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And when I went to this <inaudible> it was more like a college
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.82,0:06:06.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I did actually meet up with on campus these other people I'd gone to what's it
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.66,0:06:11.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Well I met up with one other people, and then I, eventually we go out together for like a drink and kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.26,0:06:16.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh.. and then I like, we talked at I, like college essentially, about like
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.30,0:06:20.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] How it had been, gone, being for them and how much they still hated the teacher to this day kind of thing and um [L] <laughs>

Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.34,0:06:26.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So then eventually we talked and chatted a bit and it's like
