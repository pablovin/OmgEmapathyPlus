Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.08,0:03:15.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As we reached cruising altitude.. few minutes (has pass?), so normally what you do is you lose your seat belt and go to the restroom or something.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.60,0:03:19.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They didn't switch off the lights. They said: no you should keep your seat belts.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.42,0:03:19.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.87,0:03:28.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. The lavatory was not allowed to be used. We could not you lavatory because there was turbulence. The plane was going from left to right all the time. I hate propeller plane.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.21,0:03:39.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] What?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.38,0:03:46.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because of the turbulence I experienced like, you know some times in a turbulence you fells like the airplane is falling?
