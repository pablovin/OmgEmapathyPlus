00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,300
[S] study since so long so I've always wanted to you know see the area although in this period it's really cold

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,450
[S] <breath>

14
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,950
[S] but we had some fun just went around the thing is it's really expensive there 

15
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,050
[S] such as for kinda piece of meal and a beer you end up paying twenty five euros that's not great for a student 

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,550
[L] yeah always 
[S] such as for kinda piece of meal and a beer you end up paying twenty five euros that's not great for a student 

17
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,425
[S] such as for kinda piece of meal and a beer you end up paying twenty five euros that's not great for a student 

18
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:42,400
[S] but was nice we just you know went around had some fun some local parties 

19
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,300
[S] and then he asked me about this have you ever heard this kind of really smelly fish that is supposed to be the smelliest 

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,425
food in the world ?

21
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,600
[L] yeah uh-huh
food in the world ?

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:50,725
[S] yeah well I was not so familiar with that and he told me and um apparently it's a big thing in these Scandinavian countries so
food in the world ?

23
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:59,200
[S] yeah well I was not so familiar with that and he told me and um apparently it's a big thing in these Scandinavian countries so

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,375
[S] he wanted me to try it and he said that even if it's really smelly the taste is not that bad 

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,575
[S] I was like uh ok you know I was not so sure if he's was telling the truth but anyway 

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,375
[S] we made a bet and we should try it and he I mean he hasn't he has never tried it either so

27
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,900
[S] we decided  just to you know have this thing and try it together um..

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:29,275
[S] the thing is I don't like fish in general so this fishy smell or taste is something I hate in general so even tuna or salmon so 

29
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,900
[S] for me it was kinda of a double challenge but I don't like losing bets so  I just went for it 

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:42,075
[S] so I went to the supermarket we got these you know kind of really I don't know bad looking cans so

31
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:50,975
[S] and I in my mind I was already just feeling the disgust but I just went for it so you're not supposed to eat this thing indoors 'cause you're house is gonna

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,525
[S] smell like hell for the next day so 

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,700
[S] they advised to eat outdoors so we just went to a forest behind his place (plenty?) of place you know um

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,300
[S] so yeah so we went there um I was preparing myself psychologically for.. for this 

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,825
[S] um I was really suffering actually it was like a torture the whole time like 

36
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,525
[L] <laughs> 
[S] um I was really suffering actually it was like a torture the whole time like 

37
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:13,750
[S] um I was really suffering actually it was like a torture the whole time like 

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:23,125
[S] I.. we hadn't even opened the can and I was already suffering and imagining how this thing could be and I started to think about my experience in Beijing in China when I tried the smelly tofu 

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,325
[S] yeah have you tried the smelly tofu ?

40
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:25,625
[L] I haven't 
[S] yeah have you tried the smelly tofu ?

41
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:25,675
[L] I haven't 

42
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,075
[L] <inaudible>

43
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:33,825
[S] they call it smelly tofu because it's really smelly tofu so it's a strong smell and taste was terrible 

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:43,775
[S] and you know well but my friend told me don't worry doesn't taste that bad it's just a smell once you try it it's gonna be alright I didn't believe him 

45
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:51,400
[S] so we just you know started opening the can and as soon as I just you know opened a part of the can was like wow way 

46
