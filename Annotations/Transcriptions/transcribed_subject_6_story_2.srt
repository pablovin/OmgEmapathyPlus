1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
[S] Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted? Ah let's see

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,260
[S] Alright, I was gonna tell you. So my friend had moved.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,320
[S] Or what's it called, my friend had moved away essentially [L] Uh-huh

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,160
[S] Ah.. and after I had some trouble coping with that

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,260
[S] Essentially, it took a while for me to kind of get back on my horse

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,020
[S] So I started to actually get really interested in music as kind of a coping mechanism

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,860
[S] Kind of, I got really excited about learning how to play and singing and stuff

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,000
[S] My, my parents, they wanted like a guitar or something [L] Hmm

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,840
[S] They really just treated this as a phase

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,060
[S] So they weren't  <laughs> really too interested in like indulging me in that particular point in time

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,900
[S] But uh i did manage to nag them enough to at least get them to send me to kind of a..

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,620
[S] Particular like..

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,340
[S] When I was transferring from middle school to high school kind of

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,460
[S] I had to choose which high school I wanted to go to

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,960
[S] So I convinced them to go, let me go to this kind of music oriented like high school essentially

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,080
[L] Hmm [S] Ah.. so I kind of..

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,280
[S] Got them to do that as long as the school had like maths and chemistry

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,240
[S] And like real subjects alongside the weirder musical stuff right? [L] Hmm

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,960
[S] Ah cause then my parents were happy with that

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,360
[S] So.. I yeah I went to this school kind of, I really liked it there um

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,920
[S] I really enjoyed all the courses, it was very nice, the food was very good, a bit better than here

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,520
[S] <laughs> bit of a low bar but

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,960
[S] Um.. I really enjoyed it there, but there was one course I really didn't enjoy

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,220
[S] And that course was called classical music theory [L] Okay

25
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,620
[S] And the reason I didn't enjoy that course was cause there was this one particular teacher

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,020
[S] She was, I think she was like a demon in the shape of a human being

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,420
[L] <laughs> [S] Kind of wearing human skin, she was really bad <laughs>

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,120
[S] And she really was very mean and she used to like pull students by the ears kind of [L] Hmm

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,060
[S] So it was like half abusive in some sense er..

30
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,740
[S] So that was really bad and I really hated her

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,160
[S] But I did actually meet some friends who also went to her classes

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,880
[S] Who also like we kind of united around hating this particular teacher

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,100
[S] So we used to hang out and talk about that quite a lot

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,180
[S] So that's a, there was a bonus there at least <laughs> [L] Yeah <laughs>

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,680
[S] Um.. yeah, no, so..

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,760
[S] Yeah the school is really good and I enjoyed being there

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,640
[S] Except for the class cause being with, that one class was really hell

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,200
[S] And that class was very important, cause they actually needed for your exams

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,380
[S] So at the end of the first year I think of me being there

40
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,700
[S] We had to give this mandatory presentation essentially like [L] Uh-huh

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,060
[S] Uh.. in classical music theory

42
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,000
[S] And I was very scared cause I was still fairly introverted back in this time

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,320
[S] And I had to go in front of this teacher kind of

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,320
[S] In front of everyone and in front of this particular teacher who I was really afraid of uh [L] Oh god

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,880
[S] And so I practiced a lot and I made up slides

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,300
[S] And then kind of prepared the presentation and stuff uh

47
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,860
[S] Um when the day came, I did give the presentation, I was fairly happy with it

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,180
[S] People applauded, so I thought I did a good job

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,740
[S] But then after I was done, like the teacher really started ripping into my work

50
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,080
[S] Kind of she really started to dismantle everything I'd done

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,000
[S] And then she's no this is wrong, this is bad, why did you say this [L] Hmm

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,740
[S] And that really impacted my self confidence in some sense [L] Yeah

53
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,380
[S] Cause I was still very sensitive at the time so

54
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,240
[S] I really didn't <laughs> know what to do kind of

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,700
[S] So I went home and I told my parents about this

56
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,120
[S] And then we talked to the school about it, to see if we could do something

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
[S] Cause I really just can't deal with this teacher anymore, I can't have her for another two years

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,580
[S] Um so we talked about it with the school

59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,520
[S] And they said no we can't really get rid of her, she's a very important person

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,780
[S] Kind of she's on a number of steering boards kind of

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,620
[S] So she kind of gets away with what she wants in some sense

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,900
[S] Um even though they had trouble with her before

63
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,720
[S] So the solution was essentially we came up with was

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
[S] Was unfortunately that I hate to kind of <inaudible>

65
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
[S] The school shared a lot of courses with the normal high school

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,720
[S] So I could transfer into the normal high school kind of and complete my courses there [L] Hmm okay

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,400
[S] Which was unfortunate for me kind of cause I'd be, also be leaving behind these friends I met kind of

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,300
[S] And stuff but at least like I got to avoid cause she was really just making my life miserable

69
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,480
[S] And my parents were also happy I went to a more technical school <laughs> [L] <laughs>

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,460
[L] They won <laughs> [S] Yeah they won at the end <laughs> they always do

71
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,680
[S] Uh yeah but at the end of the day I did finally graduate from this more technical school kind of, I went to high school

72
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
[S] Uh after I'd been in high school, oh no not in high school, in college, sorry

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,120
[S] And after I'd been in college for a while, I did actually meet one of the friends I met at this music school

74
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,400
[S] Um and then we all got together and met up all of them again

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,120
[L] Hmm [S] And they said they were actually playing in a band

76
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,080
[S] Ah okay cool cool, and we were talking about it and like

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,060
[S] Hey don't you want to like join us and we can like play this? Like what, me?

78
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,260
[S] <laughs> I was like surprised like what they still wanna play with me

79
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,940
[S] Like after all this time, they remembered things <breath>

80
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
[S] Or remember me at all, so um..

81
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,540
[S] I said yeah we can try it out, so eventually like I joined as a vocalist kind of, cause I actually can sing

82
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,060
[S] Don't know if you knew <laughs> [L] Yeah, that's cool

83
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,700
[S] Uh so I joined with them uh we played kind of

84
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,200
[S] And eventually we arranged to have a concert for our like some friends, a couple of months down the line

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,060
[S] And it was a really great experience, like just singing that

86
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,940
[S] Er what's it called, no a concert. It was really great. [L] Hmm

87
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,580
[S] Like I really felt free, I felt like I was liberated kind of, it was really cool [L] Yeah

88
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,940
[L] That's cool [S] And that's kind of yeah my experience with music

89
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,420
[S] And the fact that I actually did sing in a band so <laughs> in the end
