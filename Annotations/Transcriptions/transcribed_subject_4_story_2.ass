Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.22,0:00:10.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Shortly after she had moved
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.32,0:00:15.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I actually.. I haven't told you about this, I'm actually the vocalist in a band
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.62,0:00:16.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Did you know that?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.82,0:00:17.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] No.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.36,0:00:23.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <laughs> Interesting fact um.. there's actually a story behing that because
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.04,0:00:27.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er shortly after she had moved, I started to get a lot more into music, kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.02,0:00:29.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I got a lot more into like <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.12,0:00:32.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I kept listening to all of these kind of nerdy videos
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.70,0:00:39.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] About like people playing guitars and kind of showing you how to do different chords and stuff um
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.70,0:00:45.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I got really interested in that kind of and I started to like tell my parents look I wanna play an instrument, buy me an instrument kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.64,0:00:49.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah they didn't take it too seriously kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.10,0:00:54.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They just kind of take it as um.. kind of a passing flight of fancy for me essentially <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.22,0:00:58.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they didn't really agree to buy me anything too exciting <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.00,0:01:04.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um the best I could do is kind of when I was transferring into essentially high school
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.80,0:01:10.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Is like convince them to send me to a kind of a special like half music kind of specialty high school
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.82,0:01:15.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As long as they had all the other like subjects there, they had the maths and they had the chemistry and they had the stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.46,0:01:20.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it was like, I could go there as long as I did some real subjects you know, on the side <laughs> [L] Yeah, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.16,0:01:24.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. so yeah, so basically I went there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.48,0:01:27.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I, when I started there it was really great, like I learned a lot kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.68,0:01:31.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] School was great, it was really nice campus, really nice atmosphere essentially [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.04,0:01:35.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Aside from the <inaudible> in here <laughs> [L] That sucks
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.44,0:01:39.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But er yeah so.. yeah I really enjoyed it there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.24,0:01:45.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the only thing a had one problem with was this one mandatory class called classical music theory
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.22,0:01:49.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I really hated that class, and I really hated that class cause I really hated the teacher in that class
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.92,0:01:55.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I'm pretty sure she was some kind of a demon in the skin of a human you know, it was pretty bad <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.20,0:01:58.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so I really, cause she was really just a mean and cruel person
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.42,0:02:04.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like she used to drag kids around by the ears kind of, almost a bit pseudo-abusive, not great um
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.04,0:02:06.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I really hated that class kind of, it was very boring
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.52,0:02:10.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I actually met some friends who like, at that school, <inaudible> friends
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.10,0:02:14.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That we bonded over essentially just hating this one teacher kind of, it was <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.44,0:02:20.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um yeah so it was pretty <laughs> pretty dramatic to do that but we, I learned a lot and I had a great, some great fun there
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.60,0:02:24.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. that continued well for a while kind of, until a couple of months
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.56,0:02:27.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So a couple of, it was two, one year down the line or something
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.48,0:02:34.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like we were suppose give this presentation in front of the entire class on like classical music theory with this harpy of a teacher right
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.18,0:02:39.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um <laughs> so I started to, I was very nervous for, before this presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.72,0:02:43.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because like I had to, first I had to go up and present it in front of everyone, I was still a bit introverted
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.32,0:02:47.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This time has kind of subsided, I don't know if you noticed <laughs> [L] I did
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.22,0:02:50.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But um I was partially scared cause I had to give the presentation in front of everyone
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.04,0:02:54.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And partially because I had to do it in front of this teacher who I was terrified of essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.32,0:02:59.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I studied very hard for this, and I made a very good presentation, what I thought was a very good presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.08,0:03:04.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I eventually went up and gave the presentation in front of the class, I thought I'd done very well
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.30,0:03:10.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But then I started to get feedback from this teacher like, no this is ridiculous, you should've done this, this wasn't good enough, this was awful like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.60,0:03:14.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I really <laughs> ah that was really heavy for me
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.34,0:03:17.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I really inflicted a blow on my self esteem kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.24,0:03:21.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I like went back to my parents in shambles and I cried and like <breath> [L] Ah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.40,0:03:26.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I told them basically look we couldn't, I couldn't like keep going and being at the school and having to deal with this teacher kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.24,0:03:29.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I had to have her for another two years or something, it was ridiculous [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.08,0:03:34.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We talked with the school about this teacher before, they said that look she's basically there to stay, we can't do anything about it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.14,0:03:36.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So like uh it was pretty bad
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.38,0:03:41.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So what we did arrange eventually is that I could actually transfer back to the normal high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.62,0:03:44.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Where they had, because they shared a lot of courses with this music school [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.24,0:03:48.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I could kind of complete the rest of my education at this normal high school kind of, so I <breath> [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.26,0:03:52.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Transferred over there, which was a shame kind of, cause I did enjoy being at this kind of special music school
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.10,0:03:59.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I had to have her like several times a week and she was awful kind of, so yeah [L] <inaudible> yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.66,0:04:05.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I did eventually keep going to this high school and I graduated in all the stuff, kind of the most technical subjects
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.12,0:04:09.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah eventually when I went to college essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.54,0:04:14.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I actually met up with these four guys from, that I'd met from high school
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.98,0:04:16.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] From this kind of musical high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.98,0:04:20.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah and I was chatting with them kind of and we were catching up on old times er
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.56,0:04:25.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then one of them said hey we're still playing kind of, you should join us. I was like wow me? <laughs>

Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.82,0:04:34.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah so we tried out a bit and we practiced a bit and it was really fun er
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.38,0:04:39.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Actually a couple of months after I met them we then we actually had a concert kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.02,0:04:42.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I felt really grat during that concert it was amazing kind of <laughs> [L] Uh-huh nice
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.00,0:04:45.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I felt really like liberated to be able to do this kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.28,0:04:50.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was really a nice experience for me to just kind of, to let go and kind of really express myself so [L] Ah great
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.76,0:04:53.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, yeah so I keep in touch with them and
