Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.94,0:00:24.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And uh going to Brussels for the weekend [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.32,0:00:27.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] A couple of weekends ago um
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.06,0:00:29.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was very cheap, so I took it, it was night
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.38,0:00:34.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was already planning to go for a holiday for the weekend and this was a place, I hadn't seen it before [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.18,0:00:36.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I took this flight um
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.68,0:00:41.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was a night flight, pretty much I think the last flight of the night or something before they closed the airport [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.90,0:00:45.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so I reach the airport a couple of hours ago
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.02,0:00:49.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was a bit raining and it was a bit storming, so I thought, I expected a bit of delay
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.18,0:00:53.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh [S] So I reached a bit early, and I realized as soon as I reached the airport
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.84,0:00:55.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That I'm not gonna reach the boarding
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.84,0:00:58.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause the airport was full of people
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.22,0:01:00.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The check in queue was like this huge queue [L] Ah
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.82,0:01:04.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh apparently all the flights before this one were delayed because of the weather [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.50,0:01:06.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it was just jam packed
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.70,0:01:09.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um somehow I lurch through things
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.82,0:01:12.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Through security and everything, I just barely manage to
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.60,0:01:15.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Reach the boarding gate before they closed it [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.16,0:01:18.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um I think it was uh five minutes left before I <inaudible> and enter [L] Ah
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.88,0:01:22.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and then I, I was able to board the plane um
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.94,0:01:28.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And uh you know these uh some of these flights don't have like the bridge to the, to the plane
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.32,0:01:32.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You have to go down and take the bus, and the bus goes.. I hate that [L] Yeah <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.70,0:01:36.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so they just fill you up in this bus
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.16,0:01:39.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then you have to wait at the tarmac for some time [L] Of course, yeah 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.06,0:01:41.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they took the bus onto the plane
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.06,0:01:45.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And uh what I see is actually this really small propeller plane
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.98,0:01:48.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like the sixty, seventy seater or something [S] Oh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.98,0:01:51.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh which I hate a lot
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.52,0:01:56.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because I don't really trust the propeller planes that much, I have not had good experiences with it [L] <laughs> oh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.46,0:02:00.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so I.. normally I only take the bigger flights
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.02,0:02:04.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] With the, with the jet planes so that uh in my head I'm not going crazy
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.32,0:02:09.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But I didn't have an option here because I didn't even see which plane it was, just got this deal and
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.70,0:02:15.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] At that point of time I couldn't say <laughs> I'm not boarding anymore because I was like outside the plane [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.00,0:02:19.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we got in and they kind of rushed us in because they were getting late or something, so (they?)
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.04,0:02:21.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Pretty much were, were rude and just pushed us in
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.42,0:02:24.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then they said yeah get seated as soon as possible and we're gonna start and
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.60,0:02:28.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Everything.. we sat down and um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.46,0:02:31.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The, the air staff was not very polite, I would say
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.72,0:02:35.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They were just.. pushing people around, just getting them seated so that they could start
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.62,0:02:39.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It's weird.. um probably it happens with cheap flights.. anyway [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.64,0:02:43.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So ah as soon as we all ah sat in
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.04,0:02:47.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then we were ready to fly, there was announcement saying that yeah but we cannot take off right now
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.90,0:02:51.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because the air traffic control has told us that there's a bad weather
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.36,0:02:53.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we can't really took, take off
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.72,0:02:56.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And can you imagine we stayed at the tarmac for one hour?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.58,0:02:58.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Waiting for the plane to take off [L] Oh my
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.96,0:03:02.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which is weird because earlier they were just pushing is in to start
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.08,0:03:04.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And now we had to sit there for an hour [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.32,0:03:08.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it was like.. you know they don't even switch on the air conditioning while it's on the.. tarmac
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.84,0:03:13.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er just.. you couldn't breathe, it was just getting crampy, and just so bad
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.52,0:03:16.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um after an hour we actually took off
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.00,0:03:18.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. the took off was also not that great
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.18,0:03:20.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was like this weird wind thing that happened
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.48,0:03:23.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we reach this cruising altitude, er everything seemed to be fine
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.96,0:03:26.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And you know as soon as it reaches cruising, you remove your seat belt
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.34,0:03:28.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or loosen it, and you wanna use the restroom or something [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.86,0:03:31.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But they said we couldn't because there was a lot of turbulence
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.42,0:03:35.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We couldn't take off our seat belts, the lavatories were not allowed to be used, we couldn't go there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.70,0:03:40.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the plane was literally shaking left to right uh because of the turbulence [L] Oh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.06,0:03:43.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And in my head all my worst dreams about
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.26,0:03:48.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um propeller planes <laughs> that come into mind is not going, go, go well [L] Oh no <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.08,0:03:51.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then all of the sudden, the lights go off
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.04,0:03:53.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we see the lights flashing, the lightning outside
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.64,0:03:56.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we see these lights flashing in.. the plane is
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.90,0:03:58.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Scene out of a horror movie or something
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.90,0:04:02.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And uh you, we experience this uh this sudden fall
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.28,0:04:07.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You see the, sometimes when the air turbulence is the plane seems to be falling a lot, and getting up and falling [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.54,0:04:13.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But this weird because it kept on falling for like seconds, like 10, 15 seconds we fell this fall [L] Oh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.32,0:04:16.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I'm pretty claustrophobic
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.18,0:04:21.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I don't like that whole environment anyhow, and this is getting even worse for me [L] Nobody does <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.30,0:04:25.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. and then to make matters even worse
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.10,0:04:28.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The oxygen masks drop.. um [L] Oh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.30,0:04:32.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I couldn't breathe anyway.. and this is the first time I'm experiencing oxygen masks
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.58,0:04:36.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I don't know how to use it, although they tell it every time, but it's very difficult when it happens to you [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.88,0:04:40.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Somehow the guy sitting next to me helped me put it on, so I could breathe again
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.92,0:04:43.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But it was this harrowing experience, we all were scared
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.88,0:04:48.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The plane was going up and down and.. it was just.. the lights were off and
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.60,0:04:53.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I, we could see that the air staff was also pretty scared of what <laughs> was happening
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.06,0:04:57.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And after like, I think 20 minutes of this tough experience
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.10,0:04:59.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Going up and down, the plane kind of stabilized [L] Oh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.62,0:05:02.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We were asked to remove our masks, the lights came on again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.74,0:05:06.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Everybody was completely shaken um..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.14,0:05:09.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The.. they were fighting with the air staff, you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.08,0:05:11.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] What, what has happened? Aren't they gonna do anything? But er.. [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.64,0:05:14.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was just weird, the whole experience
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.24,0:05:17.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I think we were nearing our destination, so they started to descend
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.24,0:05:19.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Even the.. the landing was.. like worse
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.70,0:05:23.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We bumped onto the.. eh runway twice before we landed er.. [L] Oh
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.82,0:05:26.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I don't know what the hell was going on [L] Terrible
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.20,0:05:30.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It put me off from the air travel so much that  I canceled my flight back
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.00,0:05:34.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I didn't want to fly again.. er because I believe it was a similar flight [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.28,0:05:36.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I took the train back from Brussels, I
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.66,0:05:40.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It took me long but well.. I was at least in my head safe [L] Yeah <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.46,0:05:44.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I talk to myself, I'm never gonna take.. like a night flight again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.32,0:05:46.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Especially when I know it's a small propeller plane
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.92,0:05:48.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just put me off these propeller planes forever
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.92,0:05:54.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er I don't think.. I'll be able to fly with these planes ever in my life [L] Okay
