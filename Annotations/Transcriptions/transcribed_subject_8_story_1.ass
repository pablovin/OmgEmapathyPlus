Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.07,0:02:18.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] area where they store a bunch of planks kinda and what me and her would do is like sneak into this area and like take some planks essentially we'd sneak off some planks <laughs> nothing that <inaudible> 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.95,0:02:29.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] we were kids you do stupid stuff but what we'd do with this planks was that we made thins kind of a like go kart so we would kinda hammer the planks together to make this go kart

Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.22,0:02:54.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.35,0:02:58.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] put some (spoils?) to make it go faster it wasn't it wasn't very safe <laughs> as you can imagine what we'd do is take it this.. uh like.. an asphalted hill 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.92,0:03:06.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] that was next to my house essentially and we'd take it to the top and then someone would sit in it essentially and we'd roll it down the hill.. I know this doesn't sound like a very good idea <laughs> it's..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.97,0:03:09.15,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] were any of you wearing a hat or something?

Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.00,0:03:29.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] one time I got pretty hurt doing this.. and so what we did is we roll this thing up the hill essentially right? and I was sitting in it and she was behind me normally we'd just let me roll it down and kind of (not too bad at?) speed
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.27,0:03:39.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and what happened is one time is that she kinda gave me a <inaudible> push kinda I was sitting she'd really pushed me down the hill and it was like the thing was very 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.20,0:03:49.07,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] fast kinda so I was stuck in this go kart and I was going very fast and I was trying to control it but then it kind of (curved?) and it flipped over kinda now the problem with this is I was still in this (track?) so like my legs were still stuck in the go kart essentially so the only way I 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.07,0:03:59.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] could really like brace myself I had to brace with the right side of my body so what happened is I eventually had to like ski for a couple of feet on the pavement kinda to stop.. and I like ripped of a lot o skin there was a lot 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.92,0:03:52.65,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] uh-huh

Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.97,0:04:18.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] 'cause I was like out and it took quite a lot of time to recover I have to get a bit of stitches and so it was pretty bad <laughs> uh.. yeah no  
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.32,0:04:26.15,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] it was not great but it kind of yeah it's.. I don't really regret it too much it was a stupid thing to do but it's like it's the kind of stuff you remember kinds of stuff
