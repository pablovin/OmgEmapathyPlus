Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.80,0:01:46.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] uh.. but yeah so we did spend a lot of time we watched a lot of cartoons played some video games kind of we also used to spend.. got to a bit slightly more mischievous things kind of one thing that we'd do
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.45,0:01:46.07,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.27,0:01:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] this um.. do you know these kind of places where they keep planks before they process them for.. to make furniture kinda so they have these big like yards with planks around 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.52,0:01:57.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] yeah..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.62,0:02:07.15,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] 'cause me and her lived actually very close to one of these yards kinda so what we'd do is it we kinda of sneak in there and we kinda of steal planks kinda from the place <laughs> and what we'd do with these planks is we kind 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.82,0:02:05.05,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.15,0:02:17.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and take the planks and build them into like go karts essentially so we kind of nailed it together put some wheels on it kind of like put in..  add things we added an extra seat we added a trunk
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.27,0:02:19.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>

Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.87,0:02:44.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] what we'd do is that we'd take this go kart and then put in to the top of a hill and then someone's in the go kart and it would kind of roll down the hill kind of, does it sound like a good idea?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.62,0:02:47.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] well this is something I would do yes <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.00,0:02:57.45,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] yes <laughs> interesting because what happened was that.. this was very fun right but I did get pretty hurt at some point in time like one day by doing this

Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.45,0:03:07.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] particularly 'cause we got this thing to the top of the hill alright so <inaudible> we took it to the <inaudible> top of the hill then I sat in it and then normally we'd just let it roll down but this time she kinda
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.27,0:03:16.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] pushed me down like with the speed so I was like trying to hold down as I'm going down the hill really fast and I was like bobbling and this thing turned and flipped kinda and the thing is I was still in this right? 'cause my leg 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.17,0:03:12.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.97,0:03:26.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] was still inside the go kart and then like the <inaudible> of my body was outside the kart so what happened was while I was like.. while I it was going down the hill kind of I had.. it kinda flipped and then I had to kinda brace I could only brace with the right side of 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.17,0:03:31.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.97,0:03:37.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] my body so I had to brace against the asphalt with the right side of my body and I had to skied a bit kind of and I got.. I really <inaudible> off my (little?) skin on my arm kind of and I got very bloody
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.10,0:03:47.07,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was like screaming and completely out of it and she was screaming and I was crying and then she had to run off and get my dad kind of because I was just a bloody mess it was pretty bad <laughs>

Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.92,0:04:24.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and then she eventually let me know that she.. her dad had gotten a job in Asia essentially so that means that her and her family had to move kinda.. and this
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.80,0:04:35.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] really worried me kind of 'cause I was obviously like still a bit fragile and like.. uh.. so I was a bit scared of losing a friend kind of I was afraid o being lonely uh.. we exchanged phone numbers kinda 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.10,0:04:45.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] kinda so we could call each other when she moved uh.. this didn't really work kinda so I tried to call her and just couldn't like get through I guess Swedish sim cards didn't work too well and this was a bit before 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.12,0:04:54.87,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] like the whole social media thing so we couldn't really get in touch that way either um.. so we kinda lost contact for a while we lost contact for

Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.87,0:05:04.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] quite a long time I think about five years eventually she did contact me again kinda she contact me over Facebook once it had become a thing and we got back in touch and I was like wow

Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.32,0:05:23.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and there's one thing I did notice that definitely we both had changed quite a lot kind of while she had changed more than I had she was very.. much more mature at this point in time uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.77,0:05:32.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] so we talked but like these messages got shorter and shorter we were very different people we didn't have that much in common anymore um.. so eventually this conversation just kind of 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.92,0:05:29.25,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.97,0:05:41.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] died out and unfortunately we haven't really talked since then kind of.. so yeah unfortunate hm
