1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
[S] Before we were so rudely interrupted er.. right [L] Yeah

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,820
[S] So I told you about my friend who moved away essentially um.. [L] Uh-huh

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,360
[S] Honestly that left quite a big void in my life kind of, I was a bit lost for a while [L] Uh-huh

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,020
[S] So I started to look for kind of a way of filling the gap in some sense

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,520
[S] Kinda feeling that.. kind of acting out so to speak like <laughs> [L] Okay <laughs>

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,680
[S] Um.. I started to get really interested in music, and kind of becoming a musician 

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,420
[S] I thought it would be a really, well I need to just vent kind of, some emotions I had piled up [L] Yeah

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,880
[L] Yeah that role of artist are quite emotional [S] Hmm

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,780
[S] Yeah <laughs> good fuel, or so I hear ah.. [L] <laughs>

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,220
[S] So I started to nag my parents a lot, for like I wanna have a guitar

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,220
[S] <inaudible> nag about this [L] Okay

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,360
[S] They treated it more as a kind of passing phase

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,600
[S] Kind of that they hoped would go over so <laughs> [L] Okay <laughs>

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,020
[S] Er it was.. not that seriously no [L] They didn't take you seriously

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,340
[S] They thought it was just something I would get over in due time um.. [L] Uh-huh.. okay, uh-huh

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,100
[S] And that went on for a while, the closest I could get to kind of convincing them of anything

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,820
[S] Is that once I was going to transfer from middle school to high school

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,600
[S] I convinced them to let me go to a more like musically oriented high school

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,880
[S] As long as the high school had like proper subjects like maths and chemistry <laughs> [L] Okay.. ah, okay <laughs>

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
[S] So not just music um.. [L] Yeah

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,420
[S] So they agreed to do that

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,960
[S] And the school was very nice actually ah.. [L] Okay, that's nice.. uh-huh

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,020
[S] I really.. like the classes were very.. I learned a lot there [L] Wow

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,500
[S] The people very nice, the campus was very nice, the food was better than here <laughs> [L] <laughs>

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,600
[L] That's amazing [S] Um.. but yeah

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,880
[S] And that, er I had a really great time there, I <inaudible>

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,740
[S] Except it lasted for a while at least, there was one thing that I had, I really had a problem with [L] Uh-huh.. uh-huh

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,500
[S] And that was there's this one mandatory course we had to take, which was classical music theory [L] Okay

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,380
[S] And the big issue with that course was that there was this teacher

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,340
[S] And I'm pretty sure that she was some kind of demon in the shape of a human being kind of <laughs> [L] <laughs>

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,180
[S] Because she was really just an awful person kind of <laughs> [L] Shit

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,940
[L] Oh my god [S] She would like er

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,140
[S] She would yell at students and drag students around by the ear kind of [L] Oh shit

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,200
[L] What the hell [S] If they were misbehaving.. yeah she was not stable

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,000
[L] Okay.. wow [S] <laughs> ah..

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,740
[S] So being the, being in class with this woman was terrifying

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,900
[S] And it really like scared me kind of to have to go to her course

38
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,120
[S] Cause everything else was fine, but this is [L] This teacher was a problem

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,620
[S] This teacher was a major problem essentially [L] Okay.. uh-huh

40
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,620
[S] I did actually make friends off of those, strangely enough

41
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,140
[S] Cause like, there were these other four guys in the class, who went to the same class weirdly [L] Uh-huh

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,560
[S] And we actually bond over hating this teacher <laughs> like after the classes [L] Okay <laughs> yeah

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,060
[S] Difficult and angry all the time and yeah.. [L] <inaudible> uh-huh.. okay

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,400
[S] Yeah so, it went okay like

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,960
[S] Cause she made my life really miserable with the classes but the rest of the school stuff was kind of okay [L] Uh-huh

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,820
[S] She did have other courses but those were taken the two later years kind of [L] Okay, that's nice.. okay

47
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,660
[S] Er.. everything was kind of fine for the first year kind of [L] Uh-huh.. hmm

48
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,300
[S] Eventually we got to this point where we had to give this big presentation in classical music theory in front of the entire class [L] Okay

49
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,280
[S] I was still fairly shy and fragile at that point in time

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,300
[S] So it was difficult, so this was a scary enough prospect, of just presenting in front of the entire class for me [L] Okay

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,000
[S] It was a bit spooky [L] How many students were there?

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,160
[S] Ah there were about.. 20 something I think so [L] Okay, uh-huh

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,760
[S] Ah it was till a sizable crowd for someone so young tho [L] Okay

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,920
[S] To present in front of, you know like talking in front of 8 people is a bit errifying like <laughs> [L] Okay.. yeah.. yeah, yeah, uh-huh

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,680
[S] Ah.. so partially I was scared of presenting in front of the class

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,980
[S] But also I had to present for this teacher who I'm fairly sure was very unhinged kind of [L] Ah yes, it's awful

57
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,460
[S] Not a happy person essentially [L] Yeah <laughs> okay

58
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,880
[S] So it took me kind of, I prepared a lot for this kind of [L] Uh-huh

59
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,600
[S] I was very nervous, I prepared a lot, I prepared slides [L] Uh-huh

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,540
[S] I really rehearsed in front of a mirror kind of, to make sure it would be good um [L] Okay.. uh-huh

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,600
[S] Eventually the day came, I gave the presentation, I was fairly happy with it [L] Uh-huh

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,720
[S] Like people clapped and the they laughed in between the presentation, that was nice [L] Ah that's nice

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,700
[S] Ah but then the teacher started to give feedback and she really like ripped into my what's it called um..

64
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,800
[S] Presentation. So she really said like no this is wrong, this is awful, why you do this kind of [L] Okay

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,460
[S] <inaudible> and why did you say, should've spoken louder kind of

66
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,820
[L] Okay.. uh-huh [S] And really just like mean spirited uh feedback

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
[S] Not really constructive at all [L] Okay 

68
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
[S] I had a very tough time handling this kind of ah..

69
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,840
[S] I had a very fragile self esteem at that point in time so I was <breath> [L] Okay

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,340
[S] Difficult for me to parse the information, I suppose

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,600
[S] So it's like difficult for me to kind of absorb that [L] Yeah, of course, uh-huh

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,940
[S] So essentially.. I did kind of just go home to my parents in tears

73
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,080
[S] And I like to tell them like this isn't gonna work, I can't deal with this

74
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
[S] Ah we had to go and talk with the school

75
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,780
[S] But they said like, no we can't really get rid of her kind of

76
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,720
[S] She's on a number of boards, like she's essentially there to stay is what they kind of said [L] Oh my god 

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,840
[L] So you couldn't do anything about it either [S] No she was a, she was a permanent fixture unfortunately

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,840
[S] So there was scarcely more we could do, but she also held a bunch of other courses essentially, which was a problem [L] Ah shit, uh-huh

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,380
[S] Uh so we discussed with them and we eventually came to a solution [L] Uh-huh

80
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,840
[S] That we could transfer me to kind of, there's a high school which shared a number of courses with this

81
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,600
[S] Uh.. music oriented school, and we [L] Okay

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,160
[S] Took to that we could transfer in to me into this normal school program essentially [L] Okay

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,460
[S] And so continue my education, so I could avoid these mandatory music courses that were required from and held by this teacher [L] Uh-huh.. ah okay

84
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,920
[S] Um so.. [L] Yeah but that means you losing studying music

85
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,920
[S] Yeah, it was not great, but she made my life singularly miserable

86
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,120
[S] I kind of thought, what's it called, I can get back into it later [L] Okay

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,820
[S] My parents thought yeah he's going to study IT stuff, I was like that's fine as well right? <laughs> [L] Yes <laughs>

88
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,100
[S] Um so that's kind of, kind of what happened to me in essence [L] Okay

89
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,520
[S] So I transferred and then finished a normal like more traditional thing, I did kind of put [L] More traditional school and not

90
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,140
[S] Music enthusiasm on ice for quite a long time [L] Okay hmm

91
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,220
[S] Ah when I got to college on the other hand, but it in IT, and cause it's kind of up here <laughs>

92
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,180
[S] I did actually meet one of the guys who I met there in the corridors of the university ah [L] Okay

93
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,160
[S] And we talked a bit kind of and he said that he still like plays in a band with those other four guys 

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
[S] They still hated the teacher after having been there for he two years they had to to finish off with that teacher [L] Cool

95
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,100
[S] Ah so we talked a bit and he said ah we're playing in this band

96
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,820
[S] He actually said hey you should come and play with us, it's like what me? Really? <laughs> [L] <laughs>

97
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,660
[S] Like I was surprised, like what you remember that I can do anything, he's like yeah you're pretty good vocalist, I remember [L] Okay <laughs>

98
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,540
[S] So I was like, ah cool, yeah sure <laughs> [L] Okay, uh-huh

99
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,680
[S] I can try it, try out, so we played a bit during weekends now and then, it was

100
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,120
[S] Really it was really fun, and eventually we actually organized a bit of a concert for some friends and some other people [L] Ah that's really nice.. uh wow

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,080
[S] Yeah it went, it was really fun and I really felt like

102
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,240
[S] Liberated to kind of do it, it really like felt empowering in some sense and it really felt nice so um [L] Yeah, of course

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,020
[S] To really.. yeah connect to old friends, and to do something that [L] Connect to old friends

104
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,320
[L] You really liked [L] I kind of had, yeah, and I had kind of a dead passion

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,140
[S] To revive a dead passion was a really great experience, so it was [L] Yeah

106
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,140
[S] Great.. yeah [L] That is true, uh-huh
