10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,150
[S] where you kinda live on this <inaudible> communities kind of so it's very difficult to kinda meet people essentially <laughs> without your parents driving you somewhere uh.. yeas so I did

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:19,050
[S] <inaudible> all a bit strange uh.. that last for a while took me a while to meet a friend but eventually I did meet a friends my first friend was actually someone who I 

16
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:28,725
[S] started school essentially low middle school and one of the first friends I met was this girl kind of and she was pretty amazing and fascinating to me kinda she was very outgoing she was very 

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,425

[S] specially if you're new 'cause she's like a kind of an anchor also she spoke English which was a good plus kinda uh.. yeah so we spent a lot of time together kinda we really get to.. get up to quite a lot of stuff 

24
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:53,675

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:09,075
[S] one of the things notable things that I do remember of this time with her was that we had this like lumbered processing area where they had like store the planks for making furniture kinda so this big 

27
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:16,100
[S] area where they store a bunch of planks kinda and what me and her would do is like sneak into this area and like take some planks essentially we'd sneak off some planks <laughs> nothing that <inaudible> 

28
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,475
[L] uh ok <laughs>
[S] area where they store a bunch of planks kinda and what me and her would do is like sneak into this area and like take some planks essentially we'd sneak off some planks <laughs> nothing that <inaudible> 

29
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:18,950
[S] area where they store a bunch of planks kinda and what me and her would do is like sneak into this area and like take some planks essentially we'd sneak off some planks <laughs> nothing that <inaudible> 

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:29,025
[S] we were kids you do stupid stuff but what we'd do with this planks was that we made thins kind of a like go kart so we would kinda hammer the planks together to make this go kart

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,250
[S] thing we'd put some wheels on it.. yeah yeah it's.. was a death trap in the making but anyway we'll get to that later uh.. but we did kind trick it out a bit over the weekend
[L] oh with the wheels and all the stuff?

32
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,900
[S] thing we'd put some wheels on it.. yeah yeah it's.. was a death trap in the making but anyway we'll get to that later uh.. but we did kind trick it out a bit over the weekend

33
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,825
[L] <laughs>
[S] thing we'd put some wheels on it.. yeah yeah it's.. was a death trap in the making but anyway we'll get to that later uh.. but we did kind trick it out a bit over the weekend

34
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:38,875

35
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:49,350
[S]  kinda over the weekend kind we'd put some like yeah <inaudible> we had a seat we'd put a trunk on it or a trunkish thing um.. we'd put uh.. I'd 

36
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,225
[S] put some (spoils?) to make it go faster it wasn't it wasn't very safe <laughs> as you can imagine what we'd do is take it this.. uh like.. an asphalted hill 

37
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,000
[L] <laughs>
[S] put some (spoils?) to make it go faster it wasn't it wasn't very safe <laughs> as you can imagine what we'd do is take it this.. uh like.. an asphalted hill 

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,925
[S] put some (spoils?) to make it go faster it wasn't it wasn't very safe <laughs> as you can imagine what we'd do is take it this.. uh like.. an asphalted hill 

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:06,975
[S] that was next to my house essentially and we'd take it to the top and then someone would sit in it essentially and we'd roll it down the hill.. I know this doesn't sound like a very good idea <laughs> it's..

40
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,150
[L] were any of you wearing a hat or something?

41
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,150
[S] no no no <laughs> we were young not <inaudible> <laughs> um.. yeah as you can probably imagine this didn't always end up so well kind of there was actually 
[L] oh my god <laughs>

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,000
[S] no no no <laughs> we were young not <inaudible> <laughs> um.. yeah as you can probably imagine this didn't always end up so well kind of there was actually 

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,275
[S] one time I got pretty hurt doing this.. and so what we did is we roll this thing up the hill essentially right? and I was sitting in it and she was behind me normally we'd just let me roll it down and kind of (not too bad at?) speed

44
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:39,200
[S] and what happened is one time is that she kinda gave me a <inaudible> push kinda I was sitting she'd really pushed me down the hill and it was like the thing was very 

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:49,075
[S] fast kinda so I was stuck in this go kart and I was going very fast and I was trying to control it but then it kind of (curved?) and it flipped over kinda now the problem with this is I was still in this (track?) so like my legs were still stuck in the go kart essentially so the only way I 

46
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,925
[S] could really like brace myself I had to brace with the right side of my body so what happened is I eventually had to like ski for a couple of feet on the pavement kinda to stop.. and I like ripped of a lot o skin there was a lot 

47
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:52,650
[L] uh-huh
[S] could really like brace myself I had to brace with the right side of my body so what happened is I eventually had to like ski for a couple of feet on the pavement kinda to stop.. and I like ripped of a lot o skin there was a lot 

48
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,925
[S] could really like brace myself I had to brace with the right side of my body so what happened is I eventually had to like ski for a couple of feet on the pavement kinda to stop.. and I like ripped of a lot o skin there was a lot 

49
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,225
[L] oh that hurts
[S] could really like brace myself I had to brace with the right side of my body so what happened is I eventually had to like ski for a couple of feet on the pavement kinda to stop.. and I like ripped of a lot o skin there was a lot 

50
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:59,400
[S] could really like brace myself I had to brace with the right side of my body so what happened is I eventually had to like ski for a couple of feet on the pavement kinda to stop.. and I like ripped of a lot o skin there was a lot 

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:08,975
[S] of blood I was.. I was crying and screaming and she was crying and screaming it was pretty bad <laughs> <inaudible> something so she had to run off and get my dad essentially because this was just a disaster 

52
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:18,325
[S] 'cause I was like out and it took quite a lot of time to recover I have to get a bit of stitches and so it was pretty bad <laughs> uh.. yeah no  

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,150
[S] it was not great but it kind of yeah it's.. I don't really regret it too much it was a stupid thing to do but it's like it's the kind of stuff you remember kinds of stuff

54
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,450
[L] did you try it again?

55
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,100
[S] no no no we'd put it aside I think actually my parents told me not to do it again kinda <laughs> that thing needs to go away now like I threw it in the dump or in the trash in 

56
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,325

61
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,675
[S] experiences essentially.. uh.. this is.. also.. like sadly like our friendship didn't really last for that long I think I'd known her for about six
