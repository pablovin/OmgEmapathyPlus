Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.90,0:00:55.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Very, you know, got into this you're going to be a musician essentially

Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.00,0:01:12.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They just treated it like a phase that thought I would get over eventually kind of thing [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.16,0:01:15.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I kept nagging them but they never really let up er..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.40,0:01:17.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The closest I got to convincing them was that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.78,0:01:22.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That when I was going to transfer between a (local?) middle school to like high school [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.14,0:01:25.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They let me go to a kind of more music oriented high school
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.28,0:01:29.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] If the high school actually gave like maths and science and like real courses
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.58,0:01:32.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Instead of just the weird music courses <laughs> [L] Uh-huh like a plan b
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.28,0:01:34.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like a plan b exactly ah yeah [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.74,0:01:37.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they agreed to that, I kind of started at this school

Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.24,0:01:53.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I really enjoyed my time while I was there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.94,0:01:58.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But we'll get to that, there's one course I had a problem with, one mandatory course
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.48,0:02:01.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that course was called classical music theory [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.44,0:02:04.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and the issue I had with this course was that there was this teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.84,0:02:09.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I, she really must have been a demon in the shape of a human being kind of thing cause [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.56,0:02:13.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was just really bad, she yelled at the kids a lot
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.32,0:02:17.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She.. and she used to like take kids by the ear and drag them around the classroom and stuff like that [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.58,0:02:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was pretty awful to ever have to be in her class kind of [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.84,0:02:24.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was a really just like, terrible, terrible person [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.62,0:02:28.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And she really made my life hell <inaudible> (during?) this course, it was pretty bad [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.18,0:02:31.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um me and, I actually met some friends, just like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.20,0:02:34.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Me and these 4 other guys like used to bond over just hating this one teacher essentially [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.78,0:02:38.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause like she was so awful that we would sit and talk about how awful she was after class
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.68,0:02:41.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh [S] Um so I made some friends there at the school, which was nice
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.66,0:02:43.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just through this teacher essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.66,0:02:45.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And for the most part the school was okay
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.64,0:02:49.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Except for this one course that really like made my life awful kind of <laughs> [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.16,0:02:51.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and this continued for about a year kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.86,0:02:55.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and then after one year we had to give this very big presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.02,0:02:59.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] In this like uh what's uh classical music theory course [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.08,0:03:01.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um [L] Are you playing anything in that time?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.88,0:03:05.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh yeah I played a quite, I played a decent amount, I learned a lot
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.32,0:03:07.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um it was a lot of just normal school classes essentially 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.98,0:03:10.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I only had these music classes like an extra curricular thing like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.64,0:03:14.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] When you, sometimes you would have, other people wuld have sports, we would have music essentially [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.80,0:03:19.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. yeah and so I had to give this one presentation essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.48,0:03:21.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] To the class, in classical music theory, and..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.94,0:03:26.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was super nervous, cause I was still very shy at this point in time in some sense [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.10,0:03:29.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. but on the, cause on the one hand I had to like present everything to the entire class
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.30,0:03:32.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which is like scary enough to actually speak in front of a group of people
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.10,0:03:35.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then on the other hand I was terrified of this teacher, so like <laughs> [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.06,0:03:39.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was really scared of like what she would say about my presentation and stuff er
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.46,0:03:44.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I did prepare a lot for this presentation, I prepared slides, I practiced in front of my mirror and stuff like that [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.16,0:03:47.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah and then I finally gave this presentation kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.84,0:03:50.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um and I thought the presentation went well
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.62,0:03:54.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh I presented it to the class kind of and they all laughed throughout mostly in the presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.88,0:03:57.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They clapped when I was done, I felt pretty good about it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.98,0:04:02.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But then when I was done this teacher really ripped into like my, what's it called, presentation kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.14,0:04:06.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She really like said no why would say this, why did you do this, this was entirely wrong kind of thing [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.18,0:04:09.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And she really just like was very mean and like uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.38,0:04:12.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Mean about it, like the feedback she gave essentially [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.38,0:04:16.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and that kind of really uh really impacted my self esteem kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.40,0:04:20.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because I'm a very fra, I was a very fragile person back <inaudible> [L] Negatively
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.10,0:04:23.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, it very negatively impacted my self esteem kind of, cause I was a very fragile back then
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.86,0:04:27.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As a person I had very low self esteem still at that time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.20,0:04:31.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it was very difficult for me to handle that kind of negative unfiltered feedback kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.76,0:04:35.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so I basically returned to my parents in tears kind of <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.00,0:04:39.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And told them like look uh this is just not working like I can't deal with this teacher, I don't want to
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.28,0:04:42.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so  we went and talked with the school, but the school said they can't really do anything like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.98,0:04:45.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This lady, she, they'd had reports about her before
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.50,0:04:48.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But she's on a bunch of boards and she couldn't really be replaced that easily kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.80,0:04:52.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it was up to her how she uh her class and stuff [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.04,0:04:54.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we couldn't really deal much about that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.64,0:04:57.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But the course was still mandatory so it's like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.18,0:05:01.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She'd still be around kind of, and she made people's life difficult anyway, even when they weren't in her class
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.40,0:05:04.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we discussed possibly like just
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.20,0:05:09.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh cause we had, they were, the normal high school also shared a couple of courses with this uh music school
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.14,0:05:11.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they suggested that we could transfer
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.14,0:05:13.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] What was left of my education over to this normal high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.66,0:05:16.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I could just go back to a more technical like oriented thing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.16,0:05:19.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Where I wouldn't have to do these music courses with her [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.00,0:05:21.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah which was okay, it was a solution kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.94,0:05:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which we took uh, it wasn't, it would've been better if I could've con
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.00,0:05:27.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or I would've been happier if I could've continued with the music place
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.34,0:05:31.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But my parents were just happy that I can switch to a technical, you know, school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.56,0:05:34.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] My parents are very practical like that so <laughs> [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.34,0:05:38.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah it was unfortunate but I did eventually finish off kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.28,0:05:41.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Graduating with this kind of more technical degree in high school
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.30,0:05:45.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. yeah I didn't really pursue music too much [L] But you gave up about finding
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.46,0:05:47.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was a bit of a traumatic experience kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.04,0:05:50.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth kind of for a very long time [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.98,0:05:56.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh eventually I had to go to college after this kind of uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.30,0:06:00.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I, the weird thing is I actually did bump into one of those people I'd been in a band back at this music school
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.42,0:06:03.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Who, and they still hated the teacher by the way, cause they'd actually been there for the last two years
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.92,0:06:06.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Had to deal with the teacher the last, last two years [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.60,0:06:09.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah but we start talking a lot, and talking about how things were
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.76,0:06:11.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And he said that he and the other guys had started up a band
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.98,0:06:14.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And they play a bit casually every now and then kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.06,0:06:17.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And he said that hey yeah you should us. I was like, what? Me? <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.68,0:06:20.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was like really? <laughs> cause like I didn't like [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.20,0:06:22.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Wow I was like wow <laughs> I'm surprised you were even like remember that I exist
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.84,0:06:25.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like yeah you were a good vocalist, and like uh wow okay
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.14,0:06:30.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs> [S] Ah so <laughs> so I joined them and we like rehearsed a bit
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.28,0:06:32.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we try out some stuff and it was really fun and
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.28,0:06:36.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And eventually we actually had, have like a small concert, or a small concert for like uh
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.74,0:06:40.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Some friends and stuff, a group of friends and like
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.02,0:06:43.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It went very well, and I felt really like liberated and free and I got to do the performance kind of stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.90,0:06:46.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was really cool, I really felt amazing [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.18,0:06:49.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It really helped my self uh, self esteem quite a lot so <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.68,0:06:51.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah that was a good experience for me [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.36,0:06:53.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Cool, fantastic [S] Ah yeah
