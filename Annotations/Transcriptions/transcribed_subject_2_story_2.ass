Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So then where were we before we were rudely interrupted <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.14,0:00:07.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. right I moved to Sweden my friend had moved away kind of thing
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.52,0:00:11.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um but when I did move to Sweden I started to get more into kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.28,0:00:14.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <breath> I started really getting into music, I started listening to a lot of music
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.30,0:00:17.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I also just felt that I really wanted to kind of be cool and play a musical instrument
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.54,0:00:20.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or like at least do something with music like <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.48,0:00:23.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I kind of pestered my parents for it, but they didn't really like
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.82,0:00:28.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They treated it more as a kind of a flight of fancy, so they they didn't really care that I was interested in music
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.28,0:00:31.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Essentially like they just said yeah you do whatever <laughs> makes you feel happy
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.86,0:00:37.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They didn't want to shell out for a big like guitar or anything so <breath> that was unfortunate
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.72,0:00:39.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But er.. do you like music by the way?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.62,0:00:42.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Depends on what kind of music yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.40,0:00:46.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <laughs> That's.. a good answer <laughs> reasonable
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.42,0:00:52.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <breath> Ah yeah but eventually I did, after nagging them for a particularly long period of time
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.48,0:00:57.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I did eventually convince them that they would send me to a music oriented high school kind of <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.44,0:01:06.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As long as the high school had like kind of additional like maths and sciences, the necessary stuff, so you could do music on the side kind of an extra thing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.14,0:01:13.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I was very happy about that ah.. and once I got there I really liked it, it was like a really great school, I had great fun there, I learnt a lot
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.92,0:01:19.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. there was one such that I really hated and that was classical music theory and it was mostly because of the teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.98,0:01:25.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I'm pretty sure she was some kind of evil demon in the shape of a human being or something
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.74,0:01:30.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was pretty awful as a human being, she was mean and judgmental and <breath> [L] Ah
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.58,0:01:35.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Almost a bit spiteful <laughs> I guess side effect of having to teach children all day <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.88,0:01:45.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I suppose <laughs> but yeah I really liked it there but that one class really made my life hell essentially, I couldn't, I had trou
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.18,0:01:51.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] I did meet some frieds and actually what really brought us together was how much we hated this particular teacher <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.68,0:01:56.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which is a bit weird when you think about it but um.. if it works I guess <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.42,0:02:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. yeah so the thing was that happened was kind of especially like everything was going fine for a while
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.00,0:02:06.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But eventually we had to give this kind of big presentation on classical music theory and <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.78,0:02:12.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was really stressing out before this happened kind of, I was worried about partially giving the presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.28,0:02:16.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like I'm a bit of an introvert as per se, so like presenting is a bit of a thing in itself [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.90,0:02:21.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But then you have to present to this kind of hellion of a teacher essentially um <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.76,0:02:26.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And man I.. was scared of <laughs> scared of having to give that presentation ah..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.90,0:02:32.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But I did, I really prepared I gave a presentation, I was nervous, I thought I'd done a really good job
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.72,0:02:36.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But wow she really.. cause everyone applauded and stuff, but then she just kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.90,0:02:42.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Shredded my presentation, she said that this was wrong, you were so quiet about this, why didn't you do this better
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.66,0:02:49.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I.. couldn't handle this kind of, I just kind of broke down, I went home to my parents crying
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.76,0:02:56.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Look I can't be here, I need to take this course but this one teacher like we can't deal with her essentially like she's too much
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.60,0:03:01.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we talked to the school about it, and the school just told us like she's there to stay we can't get rid of her kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.22,0:03:09.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She's there so you have to just kind of <breath> deal with <inaudible> so what we did do is we eventually arranged a transfer back over to like a normal high school
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.46,0:03:14.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which shared a lot of courses with the musical school essentially, especially the technical subjects
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.10,0:03:19.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so then I could at least continue my schooling there so I could at least finish and graduate with a degree kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.56,0:03:26.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I did that and I finished and I eventually lost contact with these, with my friends I met there kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.26,0:03:30.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] What did happen though was later on when we well went to college kind of I eventually met up with these guys again
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.86,0:03:35.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause they'd also graduated as well from the school, finishing eventually, and they went to this one college <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.42,0:03:41.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then we all met up and I was like <laughs> it was great to see them, I hadn't seen them again for so long
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.14,0:03:46.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And they'd also been playing in a band kind of so.. we were discussing and it's like 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.80,0:03:51.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Hey don't you want to join our band? I was like what? Like me? Yeah, it's like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.24,0:03:56.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <inaudible> kind of said eh, I'd love to
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.92,0:04:03.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. so then we did practice and together as a group and then eventually we played a concert and then it was great, it was like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.34,0:04:09.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I felt so liberated, it's so weird kind of <laughs> cause i'd always been very reclusive as we mentioned
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.20,0:04:14.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So like the chance to really perform and like.. wow it was amazing, so yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.28,0:04:22.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it was a great experience, so yeah.. I got in a band and I was a vocalist so <laughs> it was a pretty great experience
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.68,0:04:24.68,Default,,0,0,0,,
