Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.08,0:01:08.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And as soon as I reach the airport, I see this like huge cue of people for check in
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.16,0:01:12.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because apparantly all the flights below, uh before that were delayed
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.96,0:01:17.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um because of the weather and there was this huge cue and
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.28,0:01:22.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Even with the two hours that I had before the boarding actually started
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.36,0:01:26.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I still just barely managed to get to board the plane
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.44,0:01:32.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because I was, the whole check in cue I had this big bag, I shouldn't have carried a big bag, which I had to check in
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.26,0:01:34.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] After this long cue of check in
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.82,0:01:37.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This, again this long cue of security
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.08,0:01:39.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It took me like almost two hours to finish all of that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.84,0:01:42.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I just barely managed the boarding
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.80,0:01:46.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And they were like closing the boarding when I actually reached it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.72,0:01:50.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You know how in some airports or in some place, they don't have the bridge to the plane
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.68,0:01:55.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And you have to get down and take the bus, and the bus goes. I hate that, I hate going to the bus.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.42,0:02:03.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And um.. so we board the bus, and with the bus we reach the plane
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.02,0:02:06.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And, and what I see is a really small plane
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.10,0:02:10.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You know one of those propeller planes, like 60, 70-seater planes
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.04,0:02:14.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I hate those propeller planes, I feel really insecure flying in those propeller planes
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.46,0:02:18.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I like jets a lot, because well you have better chance of survival for the weather, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.76,0:02:23.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Propellers are just so annoying. Strong wind and the propeller stops, it's just annoying.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.72,0:02:28.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So better than I thought it was, they kind of, they were getting late because of the delays before
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.58,0:02:32.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they just pushed us in literally, they just hurried us to our seats
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.26,0:02:34.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And said you should <inaudible> as soon as possible like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.30,0:02:38.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Not even giving us our time to you know settle down
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.08,0:02:41.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just forcing us to get in, it was a bit rude as well
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.40,0:02:45.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um to be sat down in the plane, and um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.28,0:02:49.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Then there was announcement saying that well the air traffic control won't let us fly because of the weather
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.96,0:02:51.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we were waiting for a clearance 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.96,0:02:57.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] I see. [S] And I was like why, why the hell were you just pushing us in in the first place if this was the case?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.76,0:03:02.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Can you imagine we spent one hour on the tarmac waiting for clearance to fly [L] <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.80,0:03:06.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just sitting there, and they don't even switch on the air conditioning, it's
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.44,0:03:11.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You can't breathe after some point of time, there's I mean it's not like you can open a window or something
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.88,0:03:15.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It's nothing, and it's a cramped, small plane
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.10,0:03:18.06,Default,,0,0,0,,It's just so annoying um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.06,0:03:24.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Then after an hour or something, they actually er.. we actually went to the er.. were allowed to take off
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.44,0:03:28.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The take off happened, it was not the best of the take off, you know
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.62,0:03:31.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Pretty wavering  and uh it was okay
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.64,0:03:36.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um we reached to some cruising height and then suddenly um
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.84,0:03:40.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] There's announcement that well you should not take off your seat belt 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.00,0:03:42.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because there's turbulence and bla bla and
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.82,0:03:46.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The lavatories were not allowed to be used, we can't go to the lavatories
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.48,0:03:51.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we had to just sit in this place because the plane was going from left to right because of the er turbulence
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.48,0:03:57.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. then at one point of time, suddenly I felt like this plane was falling
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.24,0:04:00.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like having a free fall, you know how in turbulence sometimes it falls down?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.88,0:04:05.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it, it's not like a small one, it just fell down for like 300, 400 feet I believe and
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.48,0:04:09.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And suddenly the lights went off, off the plane and
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.70,0:04:13.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was just free falling, there was lightning outside
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.38,0:04:18.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Through the seat, these flashes of light coming in, it was just really from a horror movie or something, it's really scary
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.64,0:04:22.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then all of the sudden these oxygen masks drop off
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.36,0:04:26.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we're asked to put them on, and I've never experienced this before in my life
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.70,0:04:30.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] These oxygen masks coming down, so I'm just, I was not able to do it
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.04,0:04:32.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so the guy next to me was able to help me
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.58,0:04:36.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I was put the oxygen mask, and I could breathe again
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.12,0:04:43.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But I could still feel like it was trying to climb up and then fall, climb up and fall, it went on for some time, I felt really sick
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.54,0:04:48.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um and scared at the same time, I thought that this is the end, I'm gonna die
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.34,0:04:52.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then um it went on for like 10, 15 minutes
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.08,0:04:58.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Of this terrible um turbulence, and then eventually it kind of smoothed out
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.18,0:05:04.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Probably climbed up to a good altitude, and we were asked to remove the masks, and the lights came on again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.08,0:05:08.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But it was like this harrowing and uh scary experience I had um
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.86,0:05:11.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I'm already scared about the air travel and the propeller planes
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.98,0:05:15.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And this was like my worst nightmare coming to life
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.94,0:05:21.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um and then we were about to reach the destination and then even the landing was bumpy
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.94,0:05:25.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We just jumped twice on, on the, on the runway 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.20,0:05:29.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um it was such a scary, annoying experience of my life
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.54,0:05:32.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That I'm scared to travel using airlines again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.90,0:05:36.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] On my way back, I canceled my flight, I took a train
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.10,0:05:40.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It took me long but fine at least I knew I was, I was safer than that
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.34,0:05:44.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] There was no, no gush of air would make me die <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.34,0:05:49.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or something, it was just uh, and I'm scared to take the plane anymore
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.06,0:05:52.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I'm pretty sure I'm gonna check if it's a jet plane or a propeller plane
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.82,0:05:56.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] How many people, never gonna take the night flights out
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.34,0:06:00.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh it was just so scary, so, so scary for me
