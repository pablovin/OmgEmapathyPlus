1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
[S] Okay, great where were we before we were interrupted..uh..hmm..

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,800
[S] Okay <laughs> so after my friend left for Asia..just a week after she had left I was bit down in the dumps kind of I didn’t really..I..<inaudible> 

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:20,540
[S] it’s just <inaudible> I was friend and he has a kind of way to distract myself in some sense ah..so I started to get a little into music..kind of, ah..do you like music?

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,340
[L] Yeah, I love music.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:29,220
[S] ah, very good <breath> cause, i got really into music, kinda and I really wanted my parents to buy me an instrument kind of like a guitar or something

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,240
[S] so it kind of ah..kind of <laughs> get my..get it out..kinda get it out of my system 

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:43,000
[S] ah..my parents viewed it more as a kind of phase essentially which is something I was going for, so they did kind of ignore me in then some regard to a large extent

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,660
[S] kind of they just thought it would pass but <breath> but I just kept nagging them so it was like..<laughs> it became a bit of a balance there

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:58,460
[S] The closest I could get was eventually I convinced them to send me to a music oriented high school kind of once I had graduated from middle school essentially

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:09,080
[S] so essentially they allowed me to go to this kind of more..with ah..a high school with a more emphasis on music, if I..could also go and attend like normal, real classes there kinda <laughs>

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,800
[S] and not just these weird musical classes. And that worked great kind of. This was very nice. 

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:25,300
[S] I had a lot of fun there, the food was good, a bit <inaudible> uh <laughs> uh..so..yeah I know really enjoyed going to school there.

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,880
[S] but there was a one thing I..one problem..one major problem I had with that school, there was this one mandatory course, called ah classical music theory

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,560
[L] <agrees>

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,960
[S] and, the problem with this course was I <inaudible>..I am pretty sure the teacher was like a kind of demon in the shape of a human kind of. 

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,160
[S] She was pretty awful. She used to really yell at students and belittle them like drag students around by the ear and stuff, it was pretty bad. 

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,580
[L] <agrees>

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,060
[S] Ah..and I really did..did not like this teacher <laughs>. She was pretty awful.

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,420
[S] Ah the good thing was that..I actually met a couple of people like me and some more students who took her class and I essentially bonded with these four guys kind of

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,920
[S] We just hating this particular teacher because she was just such an awful human being, kind of <laughs>. Ah..which was interesting <laughs>. 

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,680
[S] But, yeah, and that continued on for about a year, I went to this school, kind of I really enjoyed myself. 

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:19,540
[S] After one year essentially we had to give this presentation on Classical music theory in front of the entire class and I was very nervous about this. 

23
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,160
[S] Cause I was still very shy and uh shy kind of as a person at that point and so partially just having to present in front of the entire class was a problem

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,320
[S] and then the fact that I had to present in front of this teacher was which I was just terrified of <inaudible>..she was just evil <laughs>. 

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,640
[S] Ah..so I did spend a lot of time like practicing and preparing for this and I rehearsed and I kind of..

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:36,940
[L] <agrees>

27
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,560
[S] Well I felt fairly confident so I went up and I gave the presentation and people laughed and they, you know, applauded once I was done. 

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,120
[S] I thought I had done a really good job and uh..but once I done the teacher really like laid in to my presentation like

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,020
[S] “No, this was wrong! Why did you say this? You can’t mean this. Why did you do this? <inaudible> Can you just speak louder?” it’s like

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:01,120
[S] and I was really like distraught after this kind of cause I was a very fragile person so I actually had to go like <laughs> I basically cried essentially 

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,460
[S] and I went back home and told my parents like - “Look I can’t deal with this..kind of..this is too much for me.” 

32
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,900
[S] Um..so we had to go have a talk with the school kind of and see if we could do anything about it. 

33
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,240
[S] But like the school said that basically - “she’s on a bunch of boards. We can’t get rid of her. So she’s basically there to stay”. 

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,880
[S] Uh..and I couldn’t just deal with her anymore because like it was a mandatory course, sure, but I couldn’t handle her for another two years..

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:30,020
[S] uh..so eventually we discussed..like um..we decided to send me to..like this musical high school shared a lot of courses with a normal high school essentially

36
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,780
[S] so i could transfer over to the normal high school, without like it impacting my studies too much. 

37
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,540
[S] And my parents were also happy I was back to a more technical <laughs> subject as well so uh..yeah

38
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:48,400
[S] I eventually went to the normal high school and finished my curriculum there. It was a shame I couldn’t finish at the musical school, but <shrugs> <laughs>. Life <laughs>.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,140
[S] Yeah um I did actually meet up with one of the guys that I went to the musical school when I went to college essentially

40
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,900
[S] so once I went to college I met up with..I..all five of them. It went quite well. The guys were in the corridor..I said “hey, how are you doing?” 

41
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,460
[S] And we talked a bit <inaudible> said “Ah, we’re still playing in this band kind of..uh..with these other four guys”..I had <inaudble> to earlier on. 

42
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:13,960
[S] And then he said like “ah you should join us sometime. It would be fun!” <shrugs> it’s like “ah..yeah, yeah. I remember you are good at singing ”. Like really? um, okay <laughs>. 

43
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:23,240
[S] So I actually uh..sing for them essentially as a vocalist. I did sing, and we played there and we practiced a bit kind of and eventually we arranged to have a bit of a like concert for..um 

44
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,620
[S] some of our friends..and um..close friends and stuff and it’s like..no, it was a really good experience. 

45
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,220
[S] Cause like when we had that concert I really felt like I was alive kinda I really felt like I was on cloud nine. It was a great experience. 

46
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:41,480
[S] Ah..yeah so that was..yeah..so that’s how I kind of got to sing in the band and still keep in touch with them <laughs>.
