Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.36,0:03:02.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. Then after one hour so you can even decide I don't want to fly anymore and go out, because they won't let you out anymore.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.94,0:03:25.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As soon as we (reached?) a bit higher they never switched off the seat belt sign, so you would always had to keep it

Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.70,0:03:55.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But in my head things are going crazy because I'm thinking I'm going to die now um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.26,0:03:48.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <agrees>

Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.60,0:04:22.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The oxygen masks fall down and panicking <inaudible> 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.54,0:04:30.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because the first thing that happened to me.. you think you are prepared for that but when it actually  happen you are really scared
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.70,0:04:35.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I'm not able to put the mask on my face and I can't breath because the plane kind of had a (deep?)

Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.34,0:04:37.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <agrees>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.46,0:04:44.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And It's getting really troubling for me so the guy sitting next to me actually helped me to put on the mask so I could breath un..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.68,0:04:48.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But then again after the mask was on the lights was still off and

Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.73,0:05:28.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, so then we turned off the mask <inaudible> we took it off and we had lading
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.16,0:05:32.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Lading was bumping It was not <inaudible> lading and everything

Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.65,0:05:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] because it fells like you are dying and you can't breath because the oxygen is getting low pretty much we are falling
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.45,0:05:51.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.50,0:05:59.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. It was scary. I appreciate the pilot was able to manager all of that 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.70,0:06:06.73,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] but for me I would probably never (fly this flight?) <inaudible>
