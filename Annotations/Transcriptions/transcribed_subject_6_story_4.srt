1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
[L] Hey [S] How you doing?

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,520
[L] Fine and you? [S] Doing, doing good, doing good

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,100
[S] Um I had a terrible, terrible experience a couple of weeks ago

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,280
[S] Um [L] What happened?

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,480
[S] Um you like to air travel? You like air travel? Yeah

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,080
[S] See, see you already feel me [L] Not so much

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,080
[S] Um so I was traveling

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,940
[S] I, I got this last minute deal in one of the websites

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,320
[S] And uh going to Brussels for the weekend [L] Hmm

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,060
[S] A couple of weekends ago um

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,380
[S] It was very cheap, so I took it, it was night

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,180
[S] I was already planning to go for a holiday for the weekend and this was a place, I hadn't seen it before [L] Okay

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,680
[S] So I took this flight um

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,900
[S] It was a night flight, pretty much I think the last flight of the night or something before they closed the airport [L] Okay

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,020
[S] Um so I reach the airport a couple of hours ago

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,180
[S] It was a bit raining and it was a bit storming, so I thought, I expected a bit of delay

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,840
[L] Uh-huh [S] So I reached a bit early, and I realized as soon as I reached the airport

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
[S] That I'm not gonna reach the boarding

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,220
[S] Cause the airport was full of people

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,820
[S] The check in queue was like this huge queue [L] Ah

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,500
[S] Uh apparently all the flights before this one were delayed because of the weather [L] Hmm

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,700
[S] So it was just jam packed

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,820
[S] Um somehow I lurch through things

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,600
[S] Through security and everything, I just barely manage to

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,160
[S] Reach the boarding gate before they closed it [L] Hmm

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,880
[S] Um I think it was uh five minutes left before I <inaudible> and enter [L] Ah

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,940
[S] Uh and then I, I was able to board the plane um

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,320
[S] And uh you know these uh some of these flights don't have like the bridge to the, to the plane

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,700
[S] You have to go down and take the bus, and the bus goes.. I hate that [L] Yeah <laughs>

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,160
[S] Um so they just fill you up in this bus

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,060
[S] And then you have to wait at the tarmac for some time [L] Of course, yeah

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,060
[S] So they took the bus onto the plane

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,980
[S] And uh what I see is actually this really small propeller plane

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,980
[S] Like the sixty, seventy seater or something [S] Oh

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,520
[S] Uh which I hate a lot

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,460
[S] Because I don't really trust the propeller planes that much, I have not had good experiences with it [L] <laughs> oh

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,020
[S] Uh so I.. normally I only take the bigger flights

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,320
[S] With the, with the jet planes so that uh in my head I'm not going crazy

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,680
[S] But I didn't have an option here because I didn't even see which plane it was, just got this deal and

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,000
[S] At that point of time I couldn't say <laughs> I'm not boarding anymore because I was like outside the plane [L] Hmm

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,040
[S] So we got in and they kind of rushed us in because they were getting late or something, so (they?)

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,420
[S] Pretty much were, were rude and just pushed us in

43
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,600
[S] And then they said yeah get seated as soon as possible and we're gonna start and

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,460
[S] Everything.. we sat down and um..

45
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,720
[S] The, the air staff was not very polite, I would say

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,620
[S] They were just.. pushing people around, just getting them seated so that they could start

47
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,640
[S] It's weird.. um probably it happens with cheap flights.. anyway [L] <laughs>

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,040
[S] So ah as soon as we all ah sat in

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,900
[S] And then we were ready to fly, there was announcement saying that yeah but we cannot take off right now

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,360
[S] Because the air traffic control has told us that there's a bad weather

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,720
[S] And we can't really took, take off

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,580
[S] And can you imagine we stayed at the tarmac for one hour?

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,960
[S] Waiting for the plane to take off [L] Oh my

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,080
[S] Which is weird because earlier they were just pushing is in to start

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,320
[S] And now we had to sit there for an hour [L] Yeah

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,840
[S] And it was like.. you know they don't even switch on the air conditioning while it's on the.. tarmac

57
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,520
[S] Er just.. you couldn't breathe, it was just getting crampy, and just so bad

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,000
[S] Um after an hour we actually took off

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,180
[S] Um.. the took off was also not that great

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,480
[S] It was like this weird wind thing that happened

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,960
[S] And we reach this cruising altitude, er everything seemed to be fine

62
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,340
[S] And you know as soon as it reaches cruising, you remove your seat belt

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,860
[S] Or loosen it, and you wanna use the restroom or something [L] Yeah

64
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,420
[S] But they said we couldn't because there was a lot of turbulence

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,700
[S] We couldn't take off our seat belts, the lavatories were not allowed to be used, we couldn't go there

66
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,060
[S] And the plane was literally shaking left to right uh because of the turbulence [L] Oh

67
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,260
[S] And in my head all my worst dreams about

68
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,080
[S] Um propeller planes <laughs> that come into mind is not going, go, go well [L] Oh no <laughs>

69
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,040
[S] And then all of the sudden, the lights go off

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,640
[S] And we see the lights flashing, the lightning outside

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,900
[S] And we see these lights flashing in.. the plane is

72
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
[S] Scene out of a horror movie or something

73
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,280
[S] And uh you, we experience this uh this sudden fall

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,540
[S] You see the, sometimes when the air turbulence is the plane seems to be falling a lot, and getting up and falling [L] Yeah

75
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,320
[S] But this weird because it kept on falling for like seconds, like 10, 15 seconds we fell this fall [L] Oh

76
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,180
[S] And I'm pretty claustrophobic

77
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,300
[S] And I don't like that whole environment anyhow, and this is getting even worse for me [L] Nobody does <laughs>

78
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,100
[S] Um.. and then to make matters even worse

79
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,300
[S] The oxygen masks drop.. um [L] Oh

80
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,580
[S] I couldn't breathe anyway.. and this is the first time I'm experiencing oxygen masks

81
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,880
[S] And I don't know how to use it, although they tell it every time, but it's very difficult when it happens to you [L] Uh-huh

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,920
[S] Somehow the guy sitting next to me helped me put it on, so I could breathe again

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,880
[S] But it was this harrowing experience, we all were scared

84
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,600
[S] The plane was going up and down and.. it was just.. the lights were off and

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,060
[S] I, we could see that the air staff was also pretty scared of what <laughs> was happening

86
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,100
[S] And after like, I think 20 minutes of this tough experience

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,620
[S] Going up and down, the plane kind of stabilized [L] Oh

88
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,740
[S] We were asked to remove our masks, the lights came on again

89
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,140
[S] Everybody was completely shaken um..

90
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,080
[S] The.. they were fighting with the air staff, you know?

91
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,640
[S] What, what has happened? Aren't they gonna do anything? But er.. [L] Yeah

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,240
[S] It was just weird, the whole experience

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,240
[S] And I think we were nearing our destination, so they started to descend

94
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,700
[S] Even the.. the landing was.. like worse

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,820
[S] We bumped onto the.. eh runway twice before we landed er.. [L] Oh

96
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,200
[S] I don't know what the hell was going on [L] Terrible

97
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,000
[S] It put me off from the air travel so much that  I canceled my flight back

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,280
[S] I didn't want to fly again.. er because I believe it was a similar flight [L] <laughs>

99
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,660
[S] I took the train back from Brussels, I

100
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,460
[S] It took me long but well.. I was at least in my head safe [L] Yeah <laughs>

101
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,320
[S] And I talk to myself, I'm never gonna take.. like a night flight again

102
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,920
[S] Especially when I know it's a small propeller plane

103
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
[S] Just put me off these propeller planes forever

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,320
[S] Er I don't think.. I'll be able to fly with these planes ever in my life [L] Okay

105
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,460
[S] Weird holiday, right? Was a weird, weird holiday [L] Yeah
