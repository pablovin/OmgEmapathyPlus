93
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,100
[L] Yeah.

101
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,380
[S] As soon as we (reached?) a bit higher they never switched off the seat belt sign, so you would always had to keep it 

102
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,560
[S] As soon as we (reached?) a bit higher uh..

117
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,914

[S] And It's getting really troubling for me so the guy sitting next to me actually helped me to put on the mask so I could breath un..

129
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,360
[S] But then again after the mask was on the lights was still off and

130
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,644
[S] The.. the flashes outside the lightning outside you see this flashes of lightning coming in

131
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,000
[S] With all of us with the mask and this propeller plane doing <inaudible>

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,200
[S] This was so scary I mean this was a scariest experience. After like twenty minutes of this happening and with the masks on suddenly if became smother 
[S] With all of us with the mask and this propeller plane doing <inaudible>

133
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:10,533
[S] This was so scary I mean this was a scariest experience. After like twenty minutes of this happening and with the masks on suddenly if became smother 

134
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:20,566
[S] (when we was?) closer to our destination it started to became... they would probably flying in a different altitude or something to do that um.. 

135
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:21,366
[L] <agrees>
[S] (when we was?) closer to our destination it started to became... they would probably flying in a different altitude or something to do that um.. 

136
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,766
[S] (when we was?) closer to our destination it started to became... they would probably flying in a different altitude or something to do that um.. 

137
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:28,166
[S] Yeah, so then we turned off the mask <inaudible> we took it off and we had lading

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
[S] Lading was bumping It was not <inaudible> lading and everything

139
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,666
[L] <agrees>
[S] Lading was bumping It was not <inaudible> lading and everything

140
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,566
[S] Lading was bumping It was not <inaudible> lading and everything

141
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,600
[S] Uh.. Probably one of the worst flights experiences of my life

142
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,850
[S] Um.. Something that I've always believed that something like that would happen um..

143
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,900
[L] Yeah.
[S] Um.. Something that I've always believed that something like that would happen um..

144
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,150
[S] That feeling <inaudible> and the pane was falling I felt it really low 
[S] Um.. Something that I've always believed that something like that would happen um..

145
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,600
[S] That feeling <inaudible> and the pane was falling I felt it really low 

146
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,450
[S] because it fells like you are dying and you can't breath because the oxygen is getting low pretty much we are falling

147
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,350
[L] Yeah.
[S] because it fells like you are dying and you can't breath because the oxygen is getting low pretty much we are falling

148
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,500
[S] because it fells like you are dying and you can't breath because the oxygen is getting low pretty much we are falling

149
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,700
[S] Ah.. It was scary. I appreciate the pilot was able to manager all of that 

150
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,526
[S] but for me I would probably never (fly this flight?) <inaudible>

151
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,736
[L] Um..
[S] but for me I would probably never (fly this flight?) <inaudible>

152
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:04,947
[S] I would check which flight is (used to tell?) is it a propeller plane or something? I think <inaudible> I hated
[L] Um..
[S] but for me I would probably never (fly this flight?) <inaudible>

153
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,736

155
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,914
[S] On my way back I'd booked a flight already but i canceled the flight, I didn't take the flight

156
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,170
[L] <laugh>
[S] On my way back I'd booked a flight already but i canceled the flight, I didn't take the flight

157
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,971
[S] I took this long train because, well at least that's a train

158
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,371
[S] The chances of we dying is significantly less perhaps or something

159
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,114
[L] <laughs>
[S] The chances of we dying is significantly less perhaps or something

161
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:31,200
[S] Uh Really even a <inaudible> I have this goosebumps because of this crazy experience.

162
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,771
[L] Uh-huh
[S] Uh Really even a <inaudible> I have this goosebumps because of this crazy experience.

163
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,114
[L] Uh-huh

164
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:35,828
[S] It probably scared me for life for flights 

165
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,257
[S] I may be scared with the flights for now on.

166
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:40,771
[S] Yeah that's so scary scary experience.

167
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,485
[L] <agree>
[S] Yeah that's so scary scary experience.

168
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:43,885
[S] Yeah that's so scary scary experience.
