1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
[S] How're you doing?

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,060
[L] Fine, great thanks!

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,200
[S] How was your weekend?

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,860
[L] Yeah, it was nice, relaxing. Just recovering little bit from the PhD

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,880
[S] Great, I watched this, um, movie. You know Karate Kid?

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,200
[L] Yeah, I know, I know I watched it <inaudible>

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,880
[S] Famous movie about Daniel-San and Sensei. It's a nice movie. That reminded me, when I was practicing martial arts

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,720
[L] Uh-huh

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,480
[S] when I was a child and then a teenager 

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,140
[L] Uh-huh

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,640
[S] Started around when I was..I don't know, around five? Just my parents took me there just to play with my friends and have some fun with them

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,100
[L] Uh-huh

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,000
[S] So it not a lot about techniques or self-defense, we were just about having fun altogether. It was cool. 

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,180
[S] So I started to practice um more often. Like from twice a week, to up to three or four times a week

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,680
[L] Karate?

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,600
[S] Yeah

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,200
[L] Okay

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,240
[S] And then also a bit of Kung-Fu. Um..then I just started..I mean I was going there with my friends. 

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,700
[S] I started to take it more seriously. Like I was really, you know, into it

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,320
[L] Engaging?

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,420
[S] I was really like practicing. Um, you know when you get better and then you start to practice, more focus and so on

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,060
[L] Uh-huh

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:11,040
[S] Um, then after several years of practice I would say, you know around six or seven years, I had the chance to take part at this national tournament

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,500
[L] Uh-huh

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:19,880
[S] Of martial arts. Um..I was, yeah, I was really excited. I was not really confident that I could somehow you know, go

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,460
[L] What's your level that time? Like, black..

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,680
[S] I was yeah..I was almost black belt

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
[L] Black belt

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,100
[S] So, but these tournaments are according to different levels. So..

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,540
[L] Yeah
[S] So, but these tournaments are according to different levels. So..

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:36,840
[S] Basically, you can also have um, fights with other..with people with different color and different levels and then my master thought.. 

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,800
[L] <laughs>

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,400
[S] It's kind of you know hard. So master..my master thought actually it would be a good idea to take part of it and then we went to this place

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,120
[S] there were around hundred participants from all over the place..I mean all over the country

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,520
[L] <agrees>

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,760
[S] Really good ones. I mean I was, you know, thinking about it all the time, like, oh man, I don't know if I'm good enough for these guys

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,620
[L] Like, was your first time, right?

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,820
[S] Yeah, it was my first time. Like my first martial arts competition, my first competition in general

39
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,360
[L] Uh-huh

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,100
[S] So, I never..I never won anything. So, I was like, oh my God, it's gonna be so humiliating. But, no, I was hoping

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,560
[L] <laughs>
[S] So, I never..I never won anything. So, I was like, oh my God, it's gonna be so humiliating. But, no, I was hoping

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,320
[S] for, you know, for winning and my family was there, supporting me. Also, my master was there just asking me, you know, to empty my mind

43
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,660
[L] Uh-huh

44
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,740
[S] Just get focussed. So, empty your mind. Um, so then I had this..

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,400
[L] So you had these great supporters screaming for you
[S] Just get focussed. So, empty your mind. Um, so then I had this..

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,200
[L] So you had these great supporters screaming for you

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:33,280
[S] Yeah, kind of. You know, my parents and my friends were there. So they were, cheering me up and saying, you know, it's like, you can make it. Yeah, you know the usual things you hear in movies. it's all fake

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,000
[L] <laughs>

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,800
[S] But yeah, it came the time for my first fight. Um, and there was this huge, super huge guy, you know with this killer look in his eyes

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:42,840
[L] <laughs>

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,220
[S] You can see, he just wanted to hurt me.
[L] <laughs>

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,040
[S] You can see, he just wanted to hurt me.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,520
[L] With black clothes, while you are wearing..white one

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,400
[S] Yeah, like in the movies. You know where he had this black kimono like, you know, all ready for..Oh my God, so my legs were shaking
[L] With black clothes, while you are wearing..white one

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,720
[S] Yeah, like in the movies. You know where he had this black kimono like, you know, all ready for..Oh my God, so my legs were shaking

56
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,340
[S] I was super nervous. I couldn't really imagine even ah, hurting this guy. I was just so nervous

57
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,460
[S] I was just..I just wanted to protect myself from this huge..I mean he had this huge hands

58
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,160
[L] <laughs>

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,980
[S] But anyway, actually I look at my master, he look at me and I just like remember everything you trained..you know this

60
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,500
[L] Uh-huh

61
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
[S] Movie (sentences?) just to

62
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,100
[L] Were you washing the car like this?

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:25,620
S] Yeah. And, yeah then we started. As soon as we started, I felt a bit better. You can see all the adrenaline, you know running through your body.

64
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:33,240
[S] So, the thing is, this guy was really, was really huge, but he was not so quick, so actually I won the first match. It was really cool. 

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:41,160
[S] Um and then I got much more confident. I was like, you know, if I can beat this guy, probably I can do this with other people

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,020
[L] Beat everyone? <laughs>
[S] Um and then I got much more confident. I was like, you know, if I can beat this guy, probably I can do this with other people

67
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,040
[L] Beat everyone? <laughs>

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,980
[S] Well, yeah, not everyone, but I was..oh yeah. So that was two days of fights. 

69
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,660
[S] Um, I think I had like ten different fights, well, um, five, five fights each day.

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,400
[L] Each day
[S] Um, I think I had like ten different fights, well, um, five, five fights each day.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,300
[S] It was really demanding, cause the thing is, you know, usually um, pain comes afterwards. At the beginning, you're all, you know..

72
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,080
[L] Uh-huh

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,660
[S] Full of energy

74
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,200
[L] Yeah, yeah

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,980
[S] But then when you just go there and you just sit down and then you start to feel the pain everywhere. Maybe they hit one part of your leg and then it's swollen and it was ah

76
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,140
[S] I was, you know, with some ice and so on. But, yeah, but actually, I made it to the final

77
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,680
[L] Uh-huh

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:23,680
[S] Which was great. I couldn't even..couldn't believe it. Actually it was like, oh my God, I'm going to the final. Also, my master was like, yeah, you made it. I think, he didn't think, I could make it

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
[L] <laughs>

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:33,260
[S] But, yeah, we got to the final. Um, at that point I was super tired like also psychologically tired you know with this thing of getting ready for a fight

81
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,600
[L] Also motivated, right? You got to the final, you beat a lot of people.

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:44,380
[S] Yeah, it was a mixed, half motivation, of course when I have to face this last guy, I was super motivated

83
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:53,400
[S] But you know, you can also feel like my body was not reacting like it was supposed to. I was also a bit nervous, cause there were a lot of expectations, you know like.

84
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,600
[S] It's like in movies, oh the finals, so the guy winning is the winner, big guy and the other guy is just loser, like

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,260
[L] Uh-huh

86
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:09,980
[S] So I was kind of, you know, thinking about the movie. But, then again, just, I empty my mind, just stop thinking about anything. So okay, you're mine.

87
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,780
[S] This guy was even bigger, bigger than the first one I told you. He was really like two meters tall. Such a huge guy. 

88
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,680
[S] Ah, he had, you know, he had a scar here, really intimidating

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,340
[L] <laughs>

90
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,200
[S] From movies man. 

91
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,140
[L] <laughs>

92
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:31,460
[S] But anyways like, okay, I go for it. Um, we start a fight. Again, in the beginning he was really aggressive.

93
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:41,560
[S] so I most mostly protecting myself. But then, yeah as this thing like big guys are not so quick, so I was just like you know waiting for the right moment to hit him and I won

94
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,800
[L] Woah

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,800
[S] It was great. I mean, it was a great feeling, like I remember just this guy just fell down to the ground and I was still thinking like is he gonna stand up?

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,920
[L] <laughs>

97
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,200
[S] You know, even angrier than before. But no actually..

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,980
[L] You <inaudible> his face just to confirm <laughs>

99
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:05,940
[S] Yeah, no, you can't do that, otherwise they disqualify you. No, but, you know I won and I was so happy. I was like so tired and so happy.

100
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:15,240
[S] Ah, so the first thing I did was just, you know, go there, celebrate with my family and you know, it was actually the first and actually the only one time that I won something

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,380
[L] Nice

102
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,780
[S] Yeah, so I was watching this movie this weekend, remembering those all memories

103
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,780
[L] Uh-huh. Cool, nice.
