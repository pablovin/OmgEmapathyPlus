1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
[L] Hi
[S] How you doing?

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,600
[S] How you doing?

3
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,370
[L] Good

4
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,680
[S] Do you like traveling?

5
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,440
[L] Yeah, I do

6
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,910
[S] Do you like air traveling?

7
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,200
[L] Depends

8
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,840
[L] <laughs>

9
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,620
[S] If it's a long travel or a short one?

10
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,950
[L] No it depends on the weather where we are landing..

11
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,930
[L] Hamburg is not good usually

12
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,200
[L] Landing here is not so fun

13
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,220
[L] <laughs>
[L] Landing here is not so fun

14
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,480
[S] Ok
[L] <laughs>

15
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,510
[S] I had a similar experience, but not landing, but going away
[S] Ok

16
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,660
[S] I had a similar experience, but not landing, but going away

17
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,330
[S] Um, couple weeks ago I had to go to Brussels for a holiday and..

18
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,730
[S] I was looking a train and it takes a lot o time to go by train so..

19
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,420
[S] I thought I might take a fly that's normally expensive

20
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,770
[S] <inaudible>

21
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:35,800
[L] Uh-huh

22
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,440
[S] At the website I found this really cheap flight
[L] Uh-huh

23
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,110
[S] At the website I found this really cheap flight

24
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,480
[S] That I could use

25
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,550
[S] So I took that one, and I booked that flight and I went to the airport, I was taking it at the end of the evening this kinda of flight is almost the last one of the day

26
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:46,570
[S] So when I reached the airport, was a bit rainy and a bit windy, so I thought that it might be delayed <inaudible> early..
[S] So I took that one, and I booked that flight and I went to the airport, I was taking it at the end of the evening this kinda of flight is almost the last one of the day

27
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:53,840
[S] So when I reached the airport, was a bit rainy and a bit windy, so I thought that it might be delayed <inaudible> early..

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
[S] Took a lot of hours, actually

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,660
[S] And at last there was a huge huge queue for check-in

30
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,260
[S] Apparently, Uh, all the flights before ours were delayed because weather

31
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,860
[S] And there was a huge check-in queue and..

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,311
[S] Just at the airport.. I was waiting to many people at airport that normally doesn't have those many people there

33
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:17,288
[S] Um, this flight was reaching two hours early, I could barely manage to get to the boarding

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,755
[S] Because of the check-in, the security, it's just..

35
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,977
[S] Too many people

36
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,355
[S] And there were no systems do handle this many people

37
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,088
[L] Uh-huh

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,466
[S] So I reached at the gate at like..

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,511
[S] Two minutes or five minutes before the boarding closes

40
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,155
[S] They allowed me in but they were not very happy with that

41
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,511
[S] <breath>

42
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:38,244
[S] Um.. and you know that somehow these flights don't have these bridges to the plane then you have to go down and take the bus

43
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:38,266
[L] Yes
[S] Um.. and you know that somehow these flights don't have these bridges to the plane then you have to go down and take the bus

44
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:38,688
[L] Yes

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,933
[S] I hate that

46
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,044
[S] I hate taking buses to the plane Um..

47
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,533
[S] It's just.. cramp there, it's like hurts getting into a..

48
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,355
[S] A vessel and then transporting to somewhere else

49
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,711
[S] So it's weird

50
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,444
[S] So we took the bus Uh..

51
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:51,466
[S] And went around the airport, eventually reached our plane
[S] So we took the bus Uh..

52
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:54,466
[S] And went around the airport, eventually reached our plane

53
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,400
[S] And then I realized that is not a regular plane, was that a smaller propeller ones, like these really small ones <inaudible> or something

54
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,955
[L] Yeah
[S] And then I realized that is not a regular plane, was that a smaller propeller ones, like these really small ones <inaudible> or something

55
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:01,466
[S] And then I realized that is not a regular plane, was that a smaller propeller ones, like these really small ones <inaudible> or something

56
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:07,066
[S] And I hate those planes, I had.. my worst plane experiences <inaudible> with propeller planes

57
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:14,400
[S] I think they were not equipped to handle bad weather for starters and they just don't work very well with that weather it's not ideal for them

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,066
[S] <breath>

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,555
[S] Bad then it was a little bit to late to me to say, I don't wanna travel

60
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,422
[L] <laughs>
[S] Bad then it was a little bit to late to me to say, I don't wanna travel

61
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,466
[S] So I said, let's see how it goes
[S] Bad then it was a little bit to late to me to say, I don't wanna travel

62
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:21,377
[S] So I said, let's see how it goes

63
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,377
[S] These guys were really pushing us because we were late or something..

64
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,088
[S] And they were just heading us to our seats, and them just said sit down we gonna start soon and everything..

65
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:29,511
[L] Uh-huh
[S] And they were just heading us to our seats, and them just said sit down we gonna start soon and everything..

66
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:29,622
[S] And they were just heading us to our seats, and them just said sit down we gonna start soon and everything..

67
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:29,666
[S] And they were a bit rude, not very pleasant to <inaudible> 
[S] And they were just heading us to our seats, and them just said sit down we gonna start soon and everything..

68
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,666
[S] And they were a bit rude, not very pleasant to <inaudible> 

69
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,333
[S] Um..

70
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:43,177
[S] So we were in ours seats, we were ready to fly and then this announcement that says, Hey we can not fly right now because well the flight control says..

71
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,266
[S] The weather is bad for take-off or something and then we are grounded for now..

72
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,688
[L] Uh-huh

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,822
[S] And we don't know how long it will take

74
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,355
[S] And at part of time I thought what the heck, why they hiding it from us in that point of time then..

75
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,866
[S] You must know this for some time given the other flights that <inaudible>

76
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,860
[S] And..

77
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,955
[S] <inaudible> We were the tarmac, waiting to take-off for one hour

78
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,466
[S] And this.. they don't even switch on the air conditioning or something in this plane, so we were just sitting there almost no oxygen then..

79
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,177
[S] Just crowded up in this really small place

80
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,000
[S] It was just Uh.. <breath> just too frustrating experience just..

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,177
[S] Even before the flight took-off..

82
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:30,377
[S] i admit it did take-off, we have a.. we.. we went to the runway and took-off, the took-off was a bit shaky wasn't the most ideal one

83
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,666
[S] Probably was too windy for then, to handle such a light plane

84
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,800
[S] Um, we climb up to this Uh.. cruising altitude and..

85
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,488
[S] Like all, what we do is lose a belt <inaudible> people want to use the lavatories

86
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,955
[S] Apparently they told us not we could do that..

87
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,622
[S] We can take off ours sit belts, because was turbulence all the time

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,244
[S] The plane started moving from left to right because it was to shaky 

89
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,600
[S] They stopped the use of the lavatories <inaudible> after some time

90
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,466
[S] Um, as we were stuck in our sit, the plane just shaking and.. Um..

91
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,733
[S] In my head I'm thinking what in the heck do I take this plane? I could've..

92
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,511
[S] Spend a little more money and actually save my life or.. and not having this experience

93
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:09,333
[L] <laughs>
[S] Spend a little more money and actually save my life or.. and not having this experience

94
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,955
[S] Spend a little more money and actually save my life or.. and not having this experience

95
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:15,555
[S] Just when I was crossing my mind, it gets worst

96
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,550
[S] The lights go off, of the plane

97
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:24,155
[S] Apparently there was too much turbulence and then some systems just got damaged or flawed or something.. the lights go off..

98
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:31,133
[S] And.. it's lighting outside so we had these flashes of light coming in for us, seeming like a horror movie where..

99
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,177
[S] We were in a plane thousands of feet in the air and suddenly there is..

100
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,333
[S] There is no light there, there is light outside and..

101
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,288
[L] <laughs>
[S] There is no light there, there is light outside and..

102
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:38,377
[S] There is no light there, there is light outside and..

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,400
[S] We started felling like the.. you know.. when the turbulence goes up the plane and forces <inaudible>

104
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,644
[S] At the end of this free falling (speed?) I feel like that

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,488
[S] Not just for momentary but for like.. Twenty seconds

106
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,022
[S] It's like it felt three hundred, for hundred feet

107
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,600
[S] And.. I have.. I had big issues with this claustrophobia.. the place already crowded up..

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,355
[S] I'm not feeling well anyway

109
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,350
[S] And now this happens

110
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,600
[S] And it doesn't stop it just keep going up and then falling really fast

111
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,177
[S] And going up and falling really fast, and in one point of time the oxygen masks dropped

112
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,777
[S] At that time.. I'm.. I'm gonna die it's my last flight ever

113
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,133
[L] <laughs>

114
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,511
[S] And it's not gonna go well

115
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:23,510
[S] And I don't know how to use these masks

116
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,377
[S] We never had this experience so the guys next to me kinda help me to put this on

117
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,333
[S] <inaudible> but then for the next fifteen, twenty minutes we were just doing this

118
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,711
[S] They will try to climb up the altitude and then fall again and do this again

119
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:45,311
[S] Terrible, terrible having a experience like we had, shaky plane Uh.. If I only think about that night, just so scared about it

120
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:52,955
[S] After go fifteen, twenty minutes, it kinda stabilized Uh.. Probably we were reaching our destination so they started to..

121
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,200
[S] The lights came on again.. We took off our masks and started the descent

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,400
[S] Um..

123
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,111
[S] Even the landing was bumping.. <inaudible> twice before it landed

124
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,644
[S] At that part I decided to myself, I will never gonna fly again

125
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,977
[S] At least not in <inaudible> I'm gonna make sure it's not a small plane, not a propeller one for sure no way I'm doing that

126
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,711
[S] I canceled my flight back because it probably would be the same plane

127
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,333
[S] Um.. I took the train, took me twice the time or three times of the time but at least I was safer

128
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,600
[S] Even now I think I would never Uh.. take night flight out of this place and..

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,444
[S] Especially if it's a propeller plane

130
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,555
[S] The first think I will know before to book any flight it's what plane it is, what time it's flying

131
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,622
[S] Before I can even think what is the price I've to pay for it

132
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:42,620
[S] It was just a annoying, annoying experience and a scary one
