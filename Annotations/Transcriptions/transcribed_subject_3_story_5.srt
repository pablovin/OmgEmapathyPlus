00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,920
[S] yeah yeah uh man I had such a interesting weekend just remembering stuff from the past you know when was really

9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,820
[S] reminded my time in high school and stuff and do you like your time in high school?

10
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,420
[S] yeah somehow not all of it

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,350
[S] yeah? not all of it I think no one likes it really right? there is always something... there is always something a problem or so
[S] yeah somehow not all of it

12
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,100
[S] yeah? not all of it I think no one likes it really right? there is always something... there is always something a problem or so

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,450
[S] yeah I remember I was... I moved a lot from city to city and then I moved in the middle of high school

14
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:40,050
[S] and yeah you know new guy arrived, no one knows you, you know no one so it's kind of you know lonely and

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:49,950
[S] not connecting to everyone, to anyone in particular you know was weird and I mean I was not a good student I was really bad I mean not really bad I never failed

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:58,850
[S] but I didn't like to study I just did the minimum to pass jut to get out of there as soon as possible and yeah I really

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:09,020
[S] dislike also the teachers they were so bad they were these very old teachers with this.. not didatic at all just reading through..

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:18,620
[S] slides and stuff like that and just writing stuff but without any passion for it you know just mechanical stuff and this was not helping at all <inaudible>

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:28,500
[S] bad bad thing pretty bad thing uh.. but yeah there is.. at some point I met this teacher from history and I never liked history

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,320
[S] was kind of boring was just dates and names of people that you had to memorize otherwise you don't pass the test etc

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,400
[S] but this guy was different this guy was a new teacher he was quite young, he was very cool, very fresh, very full of life and

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:54,150
[S] he passed it to the students you know he was very dynamic it was a very different way to teach the course and although I didn't like history I

23
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:02,300
[S] start to pay attention more on the lecture you know? and then come the time for making my first exam

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,920
[S] and I failed and I was like yeah <inaudible> that makes some sense I was a bit sad and was the first time I was paying attention to the thing

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,500
[L] oh..
[S] and I failed and I was like yeah <inaudible> that makes some sense I was a bit sad and was the first time I was paying attention to the thing

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,320
[S] and I failed and I was like yeah <inaudible> that makes some sense I was a bit sad and was the first time I was paying attention to the thing

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,520
[S] and I failed but then the teacher came talk to me and then he asked yeah what's happening why you failed?

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:27,200
[S] you always pay attention you're always in the lecture you always make good questions and taking notes then we talked a lot for a long time and I got this boost of um..

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,070
[S] motivation you know like yeah it's not that bad to fail but it's important that I learn what they <inaudible> and then I can get better next time

30
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:44,300
[S] then I studied more and I started studying I started liking it a bit um.. understanding the area not just memorizing dates and numbers and stuff like that

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,250
[S] and there was a second exam and I make the second exam and I fail again

32
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,820
[S] and then was like wow something wrong and then I started to panic I really really like.. wow that's not possible

33
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:06,820
[S] I finally connected with one course I like it and I like to learn it

34
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:13,950
[S] and I failed what's wrong here and I was really down really depressed and the teacher came and talk to me hey what's happening

35
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:23,770
[S] I see that you're really interested and it's the second time you fail now but don't give up go for it and study again calm down and then I tried again to study and

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:33,700
[S] repeat to myself every night to study the course um.. the night before the final exam so I had to pass this final exam otherwise I fail the course right

37
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:42,420
[S] the night before the final exam I completely panicked I completely completely panicked so what I did? I took some stripes of paper and I make some notes on it

38
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,100
[S] and then my plan was to bring this during the exam into my sleeve so I could take it out during the exam and kind of cheat the exam

39
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,450
[S] but the.. yeah and then came the day of the exam and I did it

40
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,920
[S] so I really took it and I don't know if he saw it he didn't tell anything so I made the exam

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:10,700
[S] by the end of the exam I was feeling so bad I was feeling so.. so guilty so heavily

42
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,570
[S] these heavy shoulders you know really like wow how can I do that it was really ridiculous in the end I passed the exam

43
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:26,200
[S] but the day after it was like wow that was not right that was really like wow really really down really dense

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:34,420
[S] and I carried this with me over over and over I mean I never did this anymore I think maybe because of that maybe because of the feeling of guilt of um..

45
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:43,870
[S] failing from.. with myself so so strong like it is a lesson that I learned was really strong in my teenage times
