Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.60,0:04:27.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And, and then you know how in turbulence sometimes the plane goes up and down
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.52,0:04:29.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it feels like it's falling er
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.52,0:04:32.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I felt this fall like not just for one second
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.46,0:04:35.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But like 20, 30 seconds of this fall [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.16,0:04:39.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It felt like the plane fell like, 300, 400 feet down
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.14,0:04:42.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I was scared, I was scared as hell, I was already really, really scared

Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.98,0:05:15.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like you think about when they're telling this, during this, during take off
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.42,0:05:18.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That these will help you, but you never think this, this gonna happen [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.72,0:05:22.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And these fall off and I don't have any experience working with the oxygen mask so I, I
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.76,0:05:27.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I'm struggling with it, so the guy sitting next to me actually help me put my mask on [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.10,0:05:31.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I could breathe properly, meanwhile we still fell that the plane is falling
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.04,0:05:34.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And is going up, and then falling again, then going up, and falling again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.58,0:05:37.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And everybody is scared at this point in time [L] Just waiting for your death <laughs>

Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.82,0:05:46.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because they can't take this uh fluctuation 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.62,0:05:51.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This goes on for next 15, 20 minutes, with the masks on, flight goes up, flight goes down
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.96,0:05:54.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And after 20 minutes or so it kind of stabilized 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.64,0:05:57.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Probably we, we cleared the area from, from the bad weather
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.96,0:06:00.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We reached uh closer to our destination
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.58,0:06:04.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um and we start the descent, so we were told to turn off our masks

Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.92,0:06:12.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] People allowed to go to the lavatory, so it kind of became normal
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.62,0:06:16.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then er we landed, even the landing was bumpy
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.38,0:06:19.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We jumped onto the runway twice before we actually landed [L] <laughs>
