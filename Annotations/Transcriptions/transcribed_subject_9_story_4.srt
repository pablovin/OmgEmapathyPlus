1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
[S] Hey, how, how you doing? [L] Hello

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,160
[L] Fine, great, never better [S] Okay

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,160
[S] Um do you like traveling?

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,540
[L] Yeah, it's so nice

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,960
[S] Yeah, do you like traveling in the airplanes, do you like air travel much?

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,180
[L] Yeah, as well, like cause, I mean [S] Yeah?

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,560
[L] Even though I know that it's really nice to enjoy also the..

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,280
[L] Traveling part, but also good [S] The train, yeah

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,140
[L] Reaching the place <inaudible> [S] Reach it fast, yeah, yeah, I have the same opinion, but

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,760
[S] I'm scared of airplane travel actually

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,100
[S] And most of it because well um, um, you know?

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,460
[S] Back where I come from, like it's really small airports

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,840
[S] So it doesn't have like huge planes going, so we have these really small planes

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,700
[S] And I don't like those planes anymore.. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [L] Some noisy airplane

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,300
[S] I had a recent experience, like couple of weeks back, I had to travel to uh Brussels

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,700
[S] And took this uh cheap flight I found online on the last minute deals or something [L] <laughs>

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,060
[S] And this was like the night flight or something, like the last flight of the day

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,640
[S] Like 9:30 pm or 10 pm in the night [L] Uh-huh

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,000
[S] It was really cheap, I thought well it's one hour, shouldn't be that much of a problem

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,700
[L] Yeah.. uh-huh [S] So I took the flight, I reach the airport a couple of hours before the boarding time 

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,200
[S] Uh it was like a rainy night, like a regular raining, windy kind of an evening

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,560
[S] Uh and when I reach the airport I see, well, it's, it's

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,920
[S] Fully packed, it's like jam packed of people, and there's a huge queue for check in

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,260
[L] Hmm.. Uh-huh [S] Um apparently all the flights before mine were delayed because of the weather

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,060
[S] So there were these so many people at the airport, the check in lines

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,720
[S] The security queue, everything was completely full and there were so many people there

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,200
[S] Somehow I barely managed to reach the boarding gate

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,580
[S] In time so that I could board before they closed [L] Uh-huh

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,100
[S] I mean even though I reached two, two, two hours before I, before I had to do this but

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,380
[S] The whole rush was just too much for me to manage one time

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,520
[S] And I reach the boarding, they were not too happy to let me in

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,260
[S] Because I was just on time, and a bit, I mean a bit late

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,820
[S] Uh but they allowed me to board

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,640
[S] You know er some of these flights don't have this bridge to the, to the flight

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,060
[S] And you have to go down and take that bus [L] Yeah

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,840
[S] Uh to the flight, I don't like that bus, like [L] <laughs>

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
[S] Putting sheep in, in a bus and just letting them go

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
[S] So [L] Right so they didn't pay enough to go the right to the airplane

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,240
[S] Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? So they would take in a specially car [L] <laughs>

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,000
[S] Something no, you have to take this bus and go there [L] <laughs>

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,320
[S] So I boarded the bus and the bus took some time

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,980
[S] To go and reach to the plane, and then I see that this is

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,880
[S] The small plane with these propeller blades there [L] <laughs>

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,360
[S] And I was like oh god, this is not gonna go well.. um [L] <laughs>

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,840
[S] This really small plane, like 60 seater or 70 seater, really cramped

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,360
[L] Uh-huh, I'm so tall have to uh walk down [S] Yeah, it's really small

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,680
[S] How does fit so many people in it. And they just forced us in.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
[S] Because I think they were getting late or something, so these just rushed us into our seats [L] Uh-huh

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,460
[S] The crew were also not very polite, they were a bit rude

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,840
[S] Uh so we were forced to our seats, we sat down

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,200
[S] Um and we were suddenly told that um

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,480
[S] The, the traffic control has told us that they can't fly right now

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
[S] Because of the weather, and we have to wait for some time [L] Hmm

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,600
[S] We, we were stuck at the tarmac for one hour

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
[S] Waiting for the flight to take off hmm

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,040
[S] And at that time you know, they don't even switch on the air conditioning 

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,080
[S] It's cramped and it's like, it's really annoying

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,720
[S] And for me, I'm claustrophobic, I'm getting like really annoyed

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,260
[S] And scared at that point in time, I couldn't breathe [L] Uh-huh

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,660
[S] Just so annoying for me

61
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,280
[S] Anyway after one hour we go to the runway and we take off

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
[S] When we take off is a bit shaky

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,040
[S] I mean there's too much wind, the weather is just too bad for, for the flight

64
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,320
[S] And the propeller blades are not, they're not even strong to handle that now, that weather

65
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,280
[L] They shake a lot because of the weather [S] Way too much, way too much

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,520
[S] We reach this cruising altitude, and 

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,960
[S] The plane was literally shaking left to right and

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,660
[S] They didn't um switch off the seat belt sign

69
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,680
[S] The, the lavatories were not allowed to be used, we couldn't go [L] <laughs>

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,820
[S] Because well the plane was shaking that much [L] Yeah

71
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,220
[S] And all of a sudden we see that the lights go off

72
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,060
[S] The plane lights went off

73
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,360
[S] And there was lightning outside so we could see these flashes of light coming in

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,820
[S] Is like a scene from a horror movie or something

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
[S] You're in the flight and suddenly there's no light [L] Hmm

76
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,940
[S] And you see these flashes of uh lightning <breath>

77
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,460
[S] And everybody was scared because well it was moving too much

78
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,920
[S] And there's no light now suddenly, the, the emergency lights are on

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,520
[S] Um [L] No information to you?

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,500
[S] No the guy there was, there's too much turbulence we can't do anything

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,520
[S] We should keep calm and everything but.. well at that point in time everybody was just too scared

82
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,600
[L] Do nothing actually <laughs> [S] Yeah, we can't do anything, right?

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
[S] And, and then you know how in turbulence sometimes the plane goes up and down

84
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
[S] And it feels like it's falling er

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,460
[S] So I felt this fall like not just for one second

86
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,160
[S] But like 20, 30 seconds of this fall [L] <laughs>

87
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,140
[S] It felt like the plane fell like, 300, 400 feet down

88
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,380
[S] And I was scared, I was scared as hell, I was already really, really scared

89
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,480
[S] Because there was too many people in this small place and, and

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,180
[S] The propeller blades going with that sound

91
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,060
[S] And the plane then falls and all my, it's like all my nightmares are coming true now

92
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,240
[S] That we're gonna die or something [L] Was anyone screaming like?

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,760
[L] <laughs> [S] Uh not yet, but, but people were on the edge of the seat

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,120
[S] They were, they were not very comfortable with what happening [L] Just holding it hard

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,760
[L] The seat <laughs> [S] They, they were, you could see people are scared and a bit frightened

96
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,760
[S] And the worst happened, the oxygen masks fall down

97
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,980
[S] Which has never happened to me before [L] <laughs>

98
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,420
[S] Like you think about when they're telling this, during this, during take off

99
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,720
[S] That these will help you, but you never think this, this gonna happen [L] Yeah

100
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,760
[S] And these fall off and I don't have any experience working with the oxygen mask so I, I

101
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,100
[S] So I'm struggling with it, so the guy sitting next to me actually help me put my mask on [L] Hmm

102
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,040
[S] So I could breathe properly, meanwhile we still fell that the plane is falling

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,580
[S] And is going up, and then falling again, then going up, and falling again

104
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,440
[S] And everybody is scared at this point in time [L] Just waiting for your death <laughs>

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,100
[S] It's like this is gonna be the last flight and we're doomed [L] Uh-huh

106
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,820
[S] And everybody is scared now, you know, kids are crying on the plane

107
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,620
[S] Because they can't take this uh fluctuation 

108
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,960
[S] This goes on for next 15, 20 minutes, with the masks on, flight goes up, flight goes down

109
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,640
[S] And after 20 minutes or so it kind of stabilized 

110
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,960
[S] Probably we, we cleared the area from, from the bad weather

111
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,580
[S] We reached uh closer to our destination

112
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,920
[S] Um and we start the descent, so we were told to turn off our masks

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,920
[S] Uh the lights came on again, it was a bit uh a bit stabilized

114
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,620
[S] People allowed to go to the lavatory, so it kind of became normal

115
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,380
[S] And then er we landed, even the landing was bumpy

116
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,740
[S] We jumped onto the runway twice before we actually landed [L] <laughs>

117
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,760
[S] Worst harrowing experience of my life [L] Yeah

118
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,640
[S] Of flying, I'm already scared while I'm flying

119
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,780
[S] And this was like my, all my nightmares coming true

120
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,940
[S] I canceled my flight on the way back, I took the train

121
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,940
[S] Although it took like three times the more time, but I was, I felt much safer [L] Yeah

122
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,660
[S] I think from now on I'll be really scared traveling 

123
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,280
[L] In any kind of airplane [S] In a small plane.. in any plane, sure

124
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,080
[S] And, and I'll make sure that when I'm booking a flight, it's not a night flight

125
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,040
[S] It's a day flight and it's not a small plane

126
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,760
[S] It's a big plane, even though I have to pay more money, that's fine [L] Yeah, that's terrible

127
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,420
[S] But I just can't go through the whole thing again [L] Yeah

128
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,420
[S] I just
