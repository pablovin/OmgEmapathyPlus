61
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,900
[S] asphalted slope and then what we'd do is we take we'd take what's it called? go kart to the top of the slope and then we'd.. I'd sit in it and like ride down the hill kinda

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,725

69
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,500
[S] but it didn't always end that well like because there was this one time when I actually got pretty badly hurt when we were riding this thing so like the thing is what we were doing is the same thing we like took it to the top of this hill essentially 

70
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,375

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,825
[S] and then one of us was sitting in it normally we'd just let it roll down what happened this time was like I was sitting in the kart and then my friend she was behind me she essentially just

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,800
[S] gave me gave me a really like push like down the hill and it went really fast and I was like bobbling when I was doing down it kind of like (curved?) like flipped over kind of
