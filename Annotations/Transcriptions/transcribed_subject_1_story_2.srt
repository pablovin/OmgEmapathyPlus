22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,620
[S] So they no they said it was just a phase and it would go over

23
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:50,920
[L] Uh-huh

24
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,980

25
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,440
[S] The the best I could do kind of is that eventually when we were going to chose like um.. [L] Uh-huh

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,440
[S] Uh eventually I <laughs> I kind of uh essentially did kind of give up on this point [L] Uh-huh

30
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,120
[S] So I'd go where I wanted <laughs> [L] <laughs>

31
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,400
[S] Uh so I was really excited to go to this school kind of and the school was really amazing

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
[S] I learned a lot while I was there

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,260
[S] The only problem I had really was with the classical theory, classical like music theory [L] Uh-huh

34
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,440
[S] Which is like learning about different uh kind of <laughs> uh to play different things [L] Yeah.. uh-huh

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,340
[S] And like how the history of music is also is a big part of that [L] Uh-huh

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,800
[S] Um so I had a little trouble with that cause, mostly because of the teacher

37
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,100
[S] And the teacher was a really like.. I was pretty sure <inaudible> she was a demon in the shape of a person [L] Uh-huh

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,200
[S] Kind of she was just an awful human being um.. and uh she was really bad [L] <laughs>

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,060
[S] I did manage to make friends because of that though because what happened was that <breath> [L] Uh-huh

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,000
[S] I met four other guys who kind of also hated <laughs> we kind of developed a friendship over hating her together kind of [L] Uh-huh <laughs> yeah

41
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,600
[S] which was great um.. yeah so that went on I went on like really enjoying like [L] Uh-huh

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,120
[S] Learning how to play music and learning a lot about musical theory as well as doing other courses

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,680
[S] Uh.. while still hating this one teacher because she was really an awful human being kind of

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,980
[S] Er.. and yeah so that kept going on and eventually at some point in time what happened was that we had to give this..

45
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,340
[S] Presentation in classical music theory.. and I was, like and it was supposed to be a presentation around the entire class [L] Uh-huh

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,620
[S] And I was.. really stressing out about this like <laughs> [L] Uh-huh

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,800
[S] I studied a lot, I was very nervous cause, partially because I wanted to good and do alright [L] Uh-huh

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,520
[S] And.. but then also because like I was so scared of this teacher and what she would say cause she was obviously judging me [L] Uh-huh, yeah

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,500
[S] Um.. so I went up and I gave my presentation and for a moment <inaudible> a really good job

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,320
[S] People applauded but then she really like tore into my work

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,620
[S] Like everything I presented she said that this was wrong, why did you say this [L] Uh-huh

52
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,340
[S] You need to speak up more, you didn't due well. And like her criticism was really like harsh and mean [L] Uh-huh

53
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,140
[S] It was really like bitter criticism so like <breath>

54
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,320
[S] I really <laughs> couldn't handle it, I started to cry a bit when she <breath> [L] <laughs>

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,760
[S] When she started to be like be so cruel to me and I, I just..

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,280
[S] I got home, I cried a lot, I talked to my parents and I said look <breath>

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,880
[L] Like this isn't going to work, I can't go to a school where I have to be with this teacher and she's really just an awful person [L] Uh-huh

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,680
[S] Cause we talked to the school about this teacher before and like really they said that basically she's there to stay [L] Uh-huh

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,500
[S] So we couldn't do anything about it <breath>

61
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,860
[S] Kind of because like we, I couldn't stay there, I needed that class to pass <breath> [L] Uh-huh

62
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,580

63
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,840
[S] And ontinue my education there and that kind of worked, and it was okay [L] Yeah.. that's right

64
