00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,820
[S] The teachers were ridiculously bad. Was so, so, so..

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,980
[S] You know these very old teachers who have no didactic at all

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,240
[S] Just sit and read stuff and expect you to learn shit

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,440
[S] And.. Yeah it was, was awful year, I learned nothing, I was really bad student

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,060
[S] Really, really, always, never failing, almost failing. Almost getting D, but was really, really bad, really really was

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,540
[S] Er but there is this one professor, one teacher who make things different. He was a history teacher.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,800
[S] He really love his job, he really make it interesting. [L] Ah

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,320
[S] And.. I mean history, it's okay, there's a lot of numbers to memorize, a lot of dates. I was never good at it.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,280
[S] But he made it interesting to start with, to get into and etc <breath>

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,960
[S] Uh but I still was not good enough, wasn't all too interesting to go to school

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,940
[S] I was really bad on it. And I did my first examination on this, on this course

20
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,720
[S] I fail miserably, it was the first time I fail, I failed completely <breath>

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,940
[S] And I was feeling okay-ish, like okay yeah failed, I can deal with that, no problem. [L] Ah

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,260
[S] Um.. but then he came talk to me this, this teacher, and he was such a nice guy, he was very cool guy..

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,220
[S] He was younger than a lot of professors, very, very fresh, very easy to talk

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,840
[S] And he know how to talk to people, I think he knew how to talk to teenagers. Was something different from the other teachers, yeah I mean this helps, this helps.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,600
[S] And yeah the thing is, he came talk to me and.. asking yeah, what's wrong?

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,520
[S] Why you did, why you fail? You look so interested on the, in the the lecture and what happened? And..

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:14,060
[S] Was talking, talking, talking and we got um, get together. And I started to realize hmm actually this is not that bad and..

28
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,400
[S] I started to get into the things you know, and to.. [L] Uh-huh

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,520
[S] Not study, because I was not much study people, uh studying person

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,340
[S] But to, to pay attention on the lecture and, and so on

31
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,140
[S] But then came the second exam and I failed again

32
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:37,480
[S] And I was like oh what the fuck? What happened to me? I mean I really uh.. I like this story, I like this. What's wrong with me? And.. [L] Ah

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,560
[S] But then he came talk to me again and we had lots of conversations. And I was started feeling bad, you know. It was really, really <breath>

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,860
[S] Start to, to feel guilty because this guy was there and he was doing every thing to, to help me.

35
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:54,120
[S] And I was still not able to fulfill the, the yeah the best exam

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,920
[S] Then the third exam came, was the final exam

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,840
[S] And I had to pass this one so I had a chance to pass to, to pass to the course

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,960
[S] Otherwise I would fail the course and this was really, really bad. And I was staring to feel guilty already.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,020
[S] Because of the, this relationship with this guy, right? And..

40
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,340
[S] I studied a bit. I was never good at studying, maybe that was my problem. I was never good at studying stuff.

41
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:23,140
[S] I studied a bit but.. uh during the day before the exam, I panicked

42
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,400
[S] I really, really, completely, completely went crazy. Saying yeah, I cannot do this shit, I really cannot do this exam, I'm really bad on this and..

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,820
[S] I start to make uh.. to get some papers and put names and dates on it and put on my sleeves [L] Ah

44
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:41,380
[S] So I would cheat in the exam, er this was my plan to pass it, right? It was bad but yeah. Teenager, hmm?

45
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:49,980
[S] And during the exam, I started doing the exam, and I start to get to, to get to the good answers of my, of my uh papers

46
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,560
[S] I started to feel so bad after getting to the end of the exam

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,980
[S] And I felt so, so guilty. I felt so.. ashamed that I had to do that to pass the exam, you know? [L] Ah

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,360
[S] In the end I did pass the exam and the, the teacher came to me and talked to me and talked to me. Hey, congratulations, this is really good.

49
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,820
[S] You did it. But inside I was so destroyed.

50
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,620
[S] Because I knew that I cheated, I knew that I made something so bad

51
