00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,770
[L] <breath>
[S] They didn't switch off the lights. They said: no you should keep your seat belts.

121
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:19,850
[L] <breath>

122
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,600
[S] Ah.. The lavatory was not allowed to be used. We could not you lavatory because there was turbulence. The plane was going from left to right all the time. I hate propeller plane.

123
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
[L] Uh-huh.
[S] Ah.. The lavatory was not allowed to be used. We could not you lavatory because there was turbulence. The plane was going from left to right all the time. I hate propeller plane.

124
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,270
[S] Ah.. The lavatory was not allowed to be used. We could not you lavatory because there was turbulence. The plane was going from left to right all the time. I hate propeller plane.

125
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,490
[L] It fells you had the worse experience ever.

126
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,740
[S] It gets worse wait.

127
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,160
[L] Yeah <laughs>

128
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,390
[S] So It was going on and on left and right.
[L] Yeah <laughs>

129
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,790
[S] So It was going on and on left and right.

130
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,210
[S] After some time uh.. The lights go off at the plane

131
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,850
[L] What?
[S] After some time uh.. The lights go off at the plane

132
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:39,900
[S] After some time uh.. The lights go off at the plane

133
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,740
[S] Because of the turbulence I experienced like, you know some times in a turbulence you fells like the airplane is falling?

134
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,330
[L] Yeah.
[S] Because of the turbulence I experienced like, you know some times in a turbulence you fells like the airplane is falling?

135
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,120
[S] Because of the turbulence I experienced like, you know some times in a turbulence you fells like the airplane is falling?

136
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,030
[S] But it is like for one second or something, but this continued for like few seconds.

137
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,440
[L] Uh-huh.
[S] But it is like for one second or something, but this continued for like few seconds.

138
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,900
[S] But it is like for one second or something, but this continued for like few seconds.

139
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,000
[S] It was just like the plane falling, having a free fall.

140
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
[L] Oh my god.
[S] It was just like the plane falling, having a free fall.

141
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,150
[S] It was just like the plane falling, having a free fall.

142
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,880
[S] And then.. That was the first time I ever experienced this. I didn't know how to put on the masks.

143
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,480
[L] Ok.
[S] And then.. That was the first time I ever experienced this. I didn't know how to put on the masks.

144
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,820
[S] And then.. That was the first time I ever experienced this. I didn't know how to put on the masks.

145
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:57,900
[L] Yeah, yeah.
[S] And then.. That was the first time I ever experienced this. I didn't know how to put on the masks.

146
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,380
[S] I was struggling. I couldn't breath. The guy next to me actually helped me and then I could actually breathe then.
[L] Yeah, yeah.

147
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,520
[S] I was struggling. I couldn't breath. The guy next to me actually helped me and then I could actually breathe then.

148
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,070
[L] Yeah.
[S] I was struggling. I couldn't breath. The guy next to me actually helped me and then I could actually breathe then.

149
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,080
[S] I was struggling. I couldn't breath. The guy next to me actually helped me and then I could actually breathe then.

150
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:09,210
[S] And then.. and then the plane would climb a bit and then fall a bit, climb a bit and fall a bit. It was this next twenty minutes was the worse time ever.

151
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:09,760
[L] Oh my got, You were dying <laughs>.
[S] And then.. and then the plane would climb a bit and then fall a bit, climb a bit and fall a bit. It was this next twenty minutes was the worse time ever.

152
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,500
[L] Oh my got, You were dying <laughs>.

153
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,420
[L] <laughs> <breath>.
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

154
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:13,980
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

155
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,320
[L] (Ouch?) ok.
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

156
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,700
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

157
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,200
[L] Yeah.
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

158
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,950
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

159
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,360
[L] Oh.
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

160
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
[S] In my head I was like this is the day I'm dying. This is done. I couldn't even talk to my parents before I could die. It was just the worse thing.

161
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,720
[S] And then after like twenty minutes (or well?) of this happening. It kind of stabilize. The plane climbed up to an altitude. We were asked to remove our masks. The light came on in again.

162
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,240
[S] Uh.. The <inaudible> were apologizing for it. They couldn't do anything because of the weather was just that bad.

163
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,340
[L] That sure, but they can provide better service.

164
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,770
[S] They could be less rude at least. Yeah. That could be something.

165
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,780
[L] <laughs> Yeah <laughs>.
[S] They could be less rude at least. Yeah. That could be something.

166
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,040
[L] <laughs> Yeah <laughs>.

167
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,180
[S] And then even the landing was not really smooth. We bumped in the airport.. in the the air.. in the runaway twice before we actually landed.
[L] <laughs> Yeah <laughs>.

168
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,690
[S] And then even the landing was not really smooth. We bumped in the airport.. in the the air.. in the runaway twice before we actually landed.

169
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,760
[L] Oh my god.
[S] And then even the landing was not really smooth. We bumped in the airport.. in the the air.. in the runaway twice before we actually landed.

170
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,470
[S] And then even the landing was not really smooth. We bumped in the airport.. in the the air.. in the runaway twice before we actually landed.

171
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,200
[S] The worse experience. Literally the worse experience of in my life flying.

172
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,630
[L] But you were glad that you made it, right?
[S] The worse experience. Literally the worse experience of in my life flying.

173
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,090
[L] But you were glad that you made it, right?

174
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,980
[S] I was glad that I was alive, but I was so scary to take the flight back. I canceled the flight back. I took the train.

175
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,530
[L] <laughs>.
[S] I was glad that I was alive, but I was so scary to take the flight back. I canceled the flight back. I took the train.

176
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,480
[S] I was glad that I was alive, but I was so scary to take the flight back. I canceled the flight back. I took the train.

177
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,120
[L] Ok.

178
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,150
[S] It took longer of course but then at least I was safer then I was.

179
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,750
[L] Yeah.
[S] It took longer of course but then at least I was safer then I was.

180
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,130
[S] It took longer of course but then at least I was safer then I was.

181
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:05,520
[L] Yeah.
[S] It took longer of course but then at least I was safer then I was.

182
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,600
[S] Ans I think I will never and never take the propeller planes again. Before I book a flight I'll see which plane It is.
[L] Yeah.

183
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,020
[S] Ans I think I will never and never take the propeller planes again. Before I book a flight I'll see which plane It is.

184
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,550
[L] Um.
[S] Ans I think I will never and never take the propeller planes again. Before I book a flight I'll see which plane It is.

185
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,420
[S] Ans I think I will never and never take the propeller planes again. Before I book a flight I'll see which plane It is.

186
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:11,800
[L] Yeah.

187
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,550
[S] Never take a night flight, that hour at least, when I know the weather is not good.

188
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,060
[L] Yeah, yeah.
[S] Never take a night flight, that hour at least, when I know the weather is not good.

189

[L] Yeah, yeah.

190
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,370
[S] And never never take the propeller plane, always the jet ones.

191
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,400
[L] Yeah, yeah, but..
[S] And never never take the propeller plane, always the jet ones.

192
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,420
[S] It was like the worse experience.
[L] Yeah, yeah, but..
[S] And never never take the propeller plane, always the jet ones.

193
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,950
[L] Yeah, yeah, but..
[S] It was like the worse experience.

195
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,640
[L] Yeah, but the weather you can not judge it.

196
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,420
[S] Yeah, but this one <laughs>..

197
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:24,640
[S] See It's my flying experience for life. I'll be very cautious flying again.
[S] Yeah, but this one <laughs>..

198
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,350
[L] <laughs>.
