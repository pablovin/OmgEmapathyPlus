4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,680
[S] I was remembering some things that happened

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,680
[L] Okay [S] In the past uh hmm..

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,680
[S] You had good experiences on your high school?

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,920
[L] Yeah, some [S] Yeah, some?

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,200
[L] Yeah [S] So this was yeah kind of divided

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,840
[L] Yeah [S] Yeah, every time I ask someone, I always, I mean, it's 

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,920
[S] Very, it's really 50 50, some people really love it and enjoy it

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,900
[S] And some people really not like it much, it was a bad time [L] Hmm 

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,540
[S] For me it was a different time, I was moving from school to school, so

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,940
[S] On my second year of high school I..

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,100
[S] I moved to a new, new school, and then you know it's hard to again, with a lot of people that you don't know

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,660
[S] No one knows you, and you are the new guy, and

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,140
[S] I never could connect with there people, they're there since ever, since their kindergarten, doing together, you know and

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,140
[L] True, yeah, hmm [S] You're kind of the outsider

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,800
[S] And this <inaudible> teachers, they're very

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,500
[S] Uh this old didactic style, you know

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,920
[S] This authoritarianism in the school [L] Hmm

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,700
[S] That they don't know how to pass the, the, the, the subject properly

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,040
[S] They just yeah right something in the board and then that's all [L] Okay

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,620
[S] And.. and I was not the best student

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,320
[S] I was always average, you know, I was doing everything I could just to pass [L] Hmm hmm

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,200
[S] You know but never yeah, I never liked it, I never liked the subjects also

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,520
[S] Er but everything changed when there was a new teacher coming

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,380
[S] And he was younger than the other guys, he was more dynamic, he was more light [L] Hmm

28
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,440
[S] So he made this very good didactic, didactic when he was teaching

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,360
[S] And explaining things better, and making things interesting, he was teaching history [L] Hmm 

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,320
[S] So.. history for me was never the best subject

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,140
[S] Because I just had to memorize a lot of dates, a lot names, a lot of things like that

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,320
[S] But.. he make a difference, he make it more life, more interesting to study, you know [L] Hmm

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,200
[S] Then I start to pay attention more, and attend more his lectures

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,920
[S] Uh.. yeah uh then came the first test, the first exam, I fail

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,560
[L] Uh [S] Yeah, really bad, and that is like yeah, wow

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,660
[S] That's bad, I was starting to get used to it and to like it

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,320
[S] Uh but then he came talk to me, this teacher came talk to me

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,120
[S] Is the first time that a teacher comes and shows interest on the grades of the student for me

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
[S] Wow okay, but he was a very nice guy [L] Hmm

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,260
[S] And he was asking me yeah I saw that you were very interested on the lecture and

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,260
[S] Why you fail? What's happening?

42
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,460
[S] We talked a lot and he gave me some hints of how to study and [L] Hmm

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,440
[S] More than everything he gives me motivation of how to go on, you know

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,220
[S] Um then things happen, paying attention more in the class, attending more

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,960
[S] Second exam came, I failed again [L] Uh, no

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,800
[S] And that's like, wow, come on, that's really like [L] Yeah

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
[S] How this can be possible, right?

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
[S] I start to feel bad for myself

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,980
[S] Er.. then it's yeah no I, there was a third exam

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,060
[S] And I had to pass it, so I say you know I have to pass this third exam

51
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,680
[S] So I will make for it and.. I studied like crazy

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
[S] Really first time in my life that I was really, really studying

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,820
[S] And reading the books, and really, really trying to understand it and stuff, and writing [L] Hmm

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,800
[S] Er.. but the day before the exam

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,960
[S] I was so nervous, so anxious, that I had some panic attacks

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,720
[L] Uh [S] And say yeah, I cannot do that, I cannot do that, I cannot do that

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,240
[S] And the only solution I could find to, to calm me down

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,140
[S] Was to get some strips of paper and write the answers on it

59
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,060
[S] And then put on my sleeves, so I kind of made some cheating papers on it [L] Uh uh <laughs>

60
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,420
[S] Then I went to the test, to do the test with these papers on my sleeves,

61
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,400
[S] And.. I start to answer the test and

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,240
[S] Taking the, yeah the notes I made

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,240
[S] But in the end when I was finishing the test, I started to feel so bad

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,060
[L] Okay [S] So guilty, you know, I was wow

65
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,020
[S] That's really awful, I'm betraying the trust of this guy on me [L] Hmm

66
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,120
[S] And.. I studied so hard, and that's how I do it

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,760
[S] And wow I really felt like the worst person on earth

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,040
[S] And then, and then I hand the test, I pass

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,400
[S] I never talk to this professor, this teacher anymore

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,840
[S] But I always carry this with me, this guilt

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,260
[S] This heavy, heavy feeling, of wow this was low bottom you'll ever achieve [L] Hmm

72
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,120
[S] It was a milestone for me, I never did this anymore [L] Okay

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,980
[S] Er.. but I will always carry this guilt with me, it was really, really something [L] Uh
