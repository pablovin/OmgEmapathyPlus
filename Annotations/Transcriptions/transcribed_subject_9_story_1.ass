Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.48,0:00:17.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] First off, would you think you.. would you say that you're an introvert?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.42,0:00:20.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Um.. I would say so
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.52,0:00:26.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah.. I guess you kind of have to to be a computer scientist right? It's hard to avoid <laughs> [L] Yeah.. yeah <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.38,0:00:30.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I'd say I'm also pretty introverted obviously um..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.24,0:00:33.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Especially when I was younger, that was a big thing, I grew up in South Africa
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.36,0:00:37.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it's very easy to be introverted there cause you spend a lot of time at home essentially [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.08,0:00:39.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I spent a lot of times playing video games on my own, I..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.78,0:00:43.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was a bit lonely but I didn't really mind, like I enjoy being by myself kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.06,0:00:44.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That was good for me.. uh.. [L] Uh-huh cool
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.88,0:00:47.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I didn't know, I always thought that people in Africa like
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.20,0:00:51.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like to enjoy time outside <laughs> [L] <laughs> ah well I'm, I'm a bit special <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.42,0:00:54.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah but uh yeah and I was like that for most of my youth
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.24,0:00:56.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um and that was fairly
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.86,0:01:00.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh average thing for me until.. it did change a bit when I moved to sweden
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.74,0:01:03.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I moved to Sweden at around age of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.32,0:01:07.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] 11, 12 I think? Uh is when I moved um..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.68,0:01:10.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And once again I became a bit, a bit more introverted
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.68,0:01:14.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I'm now in a new country and I don't speak the language <laughs> kind of it's like [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.72,0:01:17.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh yeah so that didn't help um [L] Interesting
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.10,0:01:20.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it took me quite a while to find a new friend
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.02,0:01:23.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] One of the first friends I found was actually a girl from class
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.66,0:01:27.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I started in like this middle, lower middle school class kind of um..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.36,0:01:31.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I met this girl there, and she was really fascinating to me cause she was very outgoing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.66,0:01:34.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Very kind of brave, very independent
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.10,0:01:39.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which was like the exact opposite of me cause I was like shy, introverted, and scared of everything.. uh.. [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.32,0:01:44.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we spent a lot of time together, because we, I spent time like watching cartoons together
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.20,0:01:48.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Playing video games, and coming up, like going, going around doing like, yeah, it was pretty great [L] Nice
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.08,0:01:50.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah going around causing mischief and stuff uh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.92,0:01:55.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] So it helped you a lot like to.. <inaudible> on your life [S] Yeah, she really helped like
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.18,0:02:00.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, get going, it really helped me like kind of settle and get into the conf, self confidence you know? Uh.. [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.42,0:02:04.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh one of the things that we did do actually was that we lived very close to like a lumber processing plant
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.40,0:02:06.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Was where they keep all the wood for like making furniture
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.98,0:02:09.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they had a big yard where they had all these wooden planks and stuff [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.98,0:02:13.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so what her and me would do is she would sneak in
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.24,0:02:16.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we would kind of take planks, and we would steal planks
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.50,0:02:19.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we would use these to build like a go cart essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.46,0:02:22.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we had this uh box essentially, and then we had wheels on the side
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.74,0:02:25.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And her and me over the weekends would kind of build this up, so we would like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.92,0:02:28.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Nail new boards there, we could add an extra seat
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.52,0:02:32.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then we would add like a trunk, and then we would add (spoilers?) to make it go faster or something
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.54,0:02:36.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I don't know, we were kids, we weren't the smartest people <laughs> [L] Uh-huh <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.72,0:02:39.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh and what we did was that we would usually
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.72,0:02:43.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Take this and then put it on top of a hill, right? So I had this big sloping hill next to my house
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.96,0:02:48.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it was asphalted so it was like very, pretty good for speed <laughs> eh.. [L] Yeah <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.78,0:02:51.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And so we.. no, we will get there [L] It's not so safe <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.46,0:02:56.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I actually did actually injure myself quite a lot, so what we do is we  let it fall down kind of this hill um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.58,0:03:01.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] There was this one day where we rolled it, we rolled it top of the hill, I sat in
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.02,0:03:04.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then she was gonna like just let me, uh let me go down the hill
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.34,0:03:08.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But instead she kind of really pushed me, essentially, so she really rocketed me down the hill kind of [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.92,0:03:12.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I, I was like holding on for dear life and I was really like sp, spazzing out
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.64,0:03:16.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And but then the thing started to wobble and it turned to the side, and it flipped kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.14,0:03:20.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then but so then I stuck onto the side, but I was still stuck in it, right? So my legs were still stuck in the go cart [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.68,0:03:24.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Woah [S] Ah so then the only thing I could do was I had to brace with the right side of my body
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.34,0:03:26.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And so I kind of scraped the asphalt for a couple of feet
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.82,0:03:30.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And there was like I lost a lot of skin, there was a lot of blood kind of <breath> [L] <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.58,0:03:33.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was screaming and crying, she was screaming and crying
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.88,0:03:36.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And like I was like paralyzed, couldn't do anything like [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.56,0:03:41.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So she had to run off and fetch my dad, like to come and save me from this mess that I'd put myself in [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.64,0:03:44.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh yeah it was pretty.. it was pretty bad [L] Intense
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.94,0:03:48.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was pretty intense yeah, but it's the kind of like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.06,0:03:50.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It's the kind of stuff that you remember, right? So this is the kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.60,0:03:54.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it's kind of, I didn't really regret it, even though it was very, very stupid <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.78,0:03:57.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I didn't really regret, cause that was the kind of stuff you remember when you remember when you're a bit older, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.48,0:04:00.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] These things you did as a kid that would probably kill me if I did them now, right? [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.92,0:04:04.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] And you never played with her again like after this [S] Ah.. I mean

Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.70,0:04:13.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Although it didn't last for that long actually, cause I'd known her for like..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.26,0:04:15.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] 6 or 7 months I think
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.52,0:04:19.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then she let me know that her dad had got a job in Asia [L] Hmm

Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.50,0:04:56.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah it [L] Especially when you are young, I think

Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.30,0:05:15.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so it went a couple of years before I heard from her again kind of [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.80,0:05:18.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I think it was about five years uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.22,0:05:20.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then when she did actually contact me on facebook, like later on, five years later

Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.34,0:05:47.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh.. and we talked for a while about this, but I realized that like
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.60,0:05:49.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] After she'd moved she'd changed a lot
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.84,0:05:54.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Then I guess that I'd also changed a lot as well, just kind of because it's like you change a lot when you're a kid, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.22,0:05:58.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Ah.. also because of the culture that's different in a [S] Ah so we talked

Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.98,0:06:14.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we talked for a while, but like the conversation just kind of, the messages kept getting shorter
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.84,0:06:18.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we didn't really like talk that much after a while, eventually we just stopped talking [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.60,0:06:23.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I haven't really talked to her ever since, which is a shame but
