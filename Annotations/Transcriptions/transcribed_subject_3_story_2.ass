Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:04.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So cool, where were we before we got rudely interrupted ah..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.02,0:00:07.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Right, I was telling you a little bit about my friend, essentially she moved away
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.72,0:00:13.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Now, sometime after she moved away, I actually started to get more into music.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.52,0:00:21.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or like I guess I didn't listen a lot to music so I was I guess interested in the idea of playing an instrument cause I thought it was like a really cool thing, like would be a rock star-esque kind of thing
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.30,0:00:24.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. so I pestered my parents for this
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.52,0:00:29.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Naturally, I don't really have a musical bone in my body. Are you a musician? Do you play any instruments?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.28,0:00:32.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yeah, I do, some. But not professionally.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.48,0:00:34.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <laughs> just playing around
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.16,0:00:36.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Playing around, yeah. [S] Yeah, okay, fair enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.36,0:00:40.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But uh yeah, I tried to pester them, I wanna try this guitar and stuff, I wanna do this, I wanna do that
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.78,0:00:45.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They just kind of, they didn't really believe in it much, they just kind of thought it was a phase, it would go over
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.04,0:00:49.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Hopefully be a bit cheaper if I didn't get into all of this stuff ah..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.54,0:00:53.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I pestered them for it and they didn't really buy me anything too exciting
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.32,0:01:01.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] What they did eventually do for me is I managed to pester them into letting me go to a kind of a musical high school essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.42,0:01:04.44,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like where you could do all the normal subjects
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.44,0:01:09.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yeah [S] But then you could like these extra like er musical courses on the side kind of to get deeper into it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.96,0:01:15.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I really enjoyed going to this school, kind of, I leaned a lot um..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.96,0:01:19.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um but there was one course I had a problem with and that was music theory
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.28,0:01:23.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the reason I had a problem with was this course in particular is that there was this one teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.20,0:01:27.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I'm pretty sure she was some kind of a demon wearing the skin of a human kind of thing [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.60,0:01:30.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was pretty bad <laughs> like she was pretty evil um
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.64,0:01:34.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And just mean, and she used to drag kids around by the ears kind of and stuff like that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.84,0:01:40.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it was like really borderline not okay kind of stuff <breath> um..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.20,0:01:43.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I actually did meet some friends when I went to this high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.50,0:01:47.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Just and we all kind of just bonded around hating this particular woman kind of <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.20,0:01:52.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it's a bit yeah it's a bit unfortunate but she was really not a great person kind of um
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.18,0:01:55.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So like we spent some, I spent some time there, I learned a lot kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.60,0:01:59.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But then there was this one point in time where we had to give this presentation kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.38,0:02:05.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We had to give this presentation in classical musical theory, given by this woman who was a bit evil um
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.90,0:02:10.04,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I was really nervous because we were supposed to give this presentation around everybody kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.04,0:02:12.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I was partially nervous because I wanted to do a good job, get a good grade
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.74,0:02:19.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And partially because I was terrified of getting yelled at essentially like for being stupid or whatever um..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.98,0:02:24.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I did prepare a lot, I was very nervous. I did manage to give the talk, I gave the presentation.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.66,0:02:27.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I thought I'd done a good job, like everyone was clapping
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.76,0:02:30.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But then like she really laid into me after the talk like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.40,0:02:34.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She really like went for me kind of <laughs> it was pretty bad like <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.26,0:02:38.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She said why did you do this? This wasn't right, this was wrong, you should've said this, you need to speak up more kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.98,0:02:42.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I was really like <breath> I was pretty devastated after this
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.80,0:02:46.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause really it was very harsh critique, and a lot of it was mean spirited kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.26,0:02:48.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I, like I went home crying kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.68,0:02:53.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I told my parents like, look I can't be in this school with doing this teacher anymore
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.10,0:02:58.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I needed like.. that course to pass and get my grades kind of, well get my exam
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.62,0:03:01.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But uh I also was gonna start to do things with this teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.70,0:03:04.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we had talked to the school about this teacher before, but we couldn't get rid of her kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.70,0:03:09.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They just said like no there's nothing we can do really like, she's gonna stay is what we were basically told [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.98,0:03:14.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we did eventually manage to organize that I would be able to transfer into the normal schooling system
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.58,0:03:18.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which shared some of the courses with this music school um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.84,0:03:23.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I kind of finished my high school year, well years, while I was there kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.38,0:03:29.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was.. not ideal, I would have obviously have preferred to stay at the music school kind of <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.42,0:03:34.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I wasn't gonna stay there with her <laughs> not a chance, not a chance, yeah..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.08,0:03:39.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So yeah, eventually I graduated kind of, and more, with a little bit more of technical focus at school um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.62,0:03:46.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ended up in college and, when I got to college I actually did meet like the people I like eh that I went to music school with
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.82,0:03:49.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause they'd also gone there <breath> um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.82,0:03:52.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And they kind of, I talked to them a bit and like..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.72,0:03:59.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They said hey we're starting a band, do you wanna join? And I was like me? <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.26,0:04:03.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like, really? Like yeah, we remember you used to be a pretty good vocalist kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.22,0:04:07.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Wow, wow. Yeah, vocalist. So.. [L] Vocalist.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.40,0:04:10.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah eventually I said yeah, sure, I'd love to kind of like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.28,0:04:12.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I was really uh I still really liked music
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.50,0:04:18.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah I just have kind of put it to one side essentially because such traumatic experiences basically <breath> um..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.90,0:04:25.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So like eventually not too long after I met them in college kind of we all decided to like go and hold this concert there
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.88,0:04:31.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we had our first concert and like it went great I felt like I was on the cloud, walking on clouds kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.10,0:04:34.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I felt like a god, it was amazing <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.22,0:04:39.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah so eventually yeah that's what ended up, I eventually ended up as the vocalist in a band
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.34,0:04:44.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So yeah, pretty good <laughs> [S] Yeah, I'm amazed that I actually got there kind of, I thought it was over, but yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.90,0:04:49.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <breath> Yeah, that was a great experience. [L] Yeah, it was, probably.
