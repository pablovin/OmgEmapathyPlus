Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.10,0:02:33.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and not being used and stuff and what we'd do with this planks is we kind of build a go kart with them so we'd like take some hammer and nails like nail things together we'd put some wheels on it 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.02,0:02:35.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] very creative <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.27,0:02:38.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.55,0:02:43.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] kind of.. yeah.. I mean if you're a kid you've got to limitless creativity right? yeah so it's like we nailed this 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.42,0:02:41.35,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] that's true 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.02,0:02:53.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] this thing together we'd put an extra seat in it and we'd put.. we'd put a trunk on it and like (spoils?) to make it go faster or something I don't know.. like I don't know it's kinds in the camp we'd do things just it's nail 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.80,0:02:50.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] yeah?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.72,0:02:56.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] yeah.. yeah that's true
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.20,0:03:03.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] things to kind that we think that looks cool right.. and this thing kinda of workedish.. like what we did was actually we had this big slope next to my house essentially which is like an asphalted  
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.90,0:03:04.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.70,0:03:12.65,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] oh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.22,0:03:12.67,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] asphalted slope and then what we'd do is we take we'd take what's it called? go kart to the top of the slope and then we'd.. I'd sit in it and like ride down the hill kinda
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.77,0:03:18.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs> very courageous 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.67,0:03:21.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] this was not the best idea I'm sure you can imagine like it's unlimited.. it's like.. yeah well I mean it didn't always.. It wasn't.. It was courageous 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.77,0:03:32.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] but it didn't always end that well like because there was this one time when I actually got pretty badly hurt when we were riding this thing so like the thing is what we were doing is the same thing we like took it to the top of this hill essentially 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.50,0:03:24.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] ok
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.45,0:03:26.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] oh

Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.20,0:03:41.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and then one of us was sitting in it normally we'd just let it roll down what happened this time was like I was sitting in the kart and then my friend she was behind me she essentially just 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.80,0:03:44.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] oh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.52,0:03:51.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] gave me gave me a really like push like down the hill and it went really fast and I was like bobbling when I was doing down it kind of like (curved?) like flipped over kind of 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.45,0:03:51.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] oh no
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.17,0:04:00.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and like the problem was like I was still stuck in the kart right? so like I.. my legs were still in the kart so I couldn't really get out so I hat to like brace with the right of my body on the way down and I really like hit the ground like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.05,0:04:08.47,Default,,0,0,0,,[L]uh.. oh my god 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.90,0:04:10.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] and I slid a bit like kind of and really like scraped off a layer of skin and there was a lot of blood and I was like screaming and half out a bit ans she was like 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.52,0:04:19.87,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] panicking and she had to run of and get my dad kinda 'cause I was just lying there in the blood screaming this was pretty bad but you get up to stupid things as kid you know, as kid you're

Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.00,0:04:39.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] mischief and like weird stuff like that kinda it was for a couple of months at least uh.. sadly this didn't really last 'cause I knew her for a couple of months but actually just after I had moved 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.35,0:04:38.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] oh

Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.70,0:05:09.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] sad and almost afraid of being really lonely again essentially 'cause I got to used to her being around kinda.. so we exchange phone numbers 'cause this was a bit before like when social media really
