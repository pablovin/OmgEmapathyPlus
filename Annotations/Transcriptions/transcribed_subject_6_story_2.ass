Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted? Ah let's see
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.92,0:00:06.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Alright, I was gonna tell you. So my friend had moved.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.26,0:00:09.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or what's it called, my friend had moved away essentially [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.32,0:00:13.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. and after I had some trouble coping with that
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.16,0:00:15.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Essentially, it took a while for me to kind of get back on my horse
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.26,0:00:20.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I started to actually get really interested in music as kind of a coping mechanism
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.02,0:00:23.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Kind of, I got really excited about learning how to play and singing and stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.86,0:00:27.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] My, my parents, they wanted like a guitar or something [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.00,0:00:28.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They really just treated this as a phase
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.84,0:00:34.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they weren't  <laughs> really too interested in like indulging me in that particular point in time
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.06,0:00:38.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But uh i did manage to nag them enough to at least get them to send me to kind of a..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.90,0:00:41.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Particular like..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.62,0:00:44.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] When I was transferring from middle school to high school kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.34,0:00:45.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I had to choose which high school I wanted to go to
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.46,0:00:49.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I convinced them to go, let me go to this kind of music oriented like high school essentially
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.96,0:00:54.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Hmm [S] Ah.. so I kind of..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.08,0:00:58.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Got them to do that as long as the school had like maths and chemistry
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.28,0:01:02.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And like real subjects alongside the weirder musical stuff right? [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.24,0:01:03.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah cause then my parents were happy with that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.96,0:01:08.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So.. I yeah I went to this school kind of, I really liked it there um
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.36,0:01:12.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I really enjoyed all the courses, it was very nice, the food was very good, a bit better than here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.92,0:01:15.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <laughs> bit of a low bar but
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.52,0:01:18.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. I really enjoyed it there, but there was one course I really didn't enjoy
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.96,0:01:22.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that course was called classical music theory [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.22,0:01:25.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the reason I didn't enjoy that course was cause there was this one particular teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.62,0:01:29.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She was, I think she was like a demon in the shape of a human being
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.02,0:01:31.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs> [S] Kind of wearing human skin, she was really bad <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.42,0:01:35.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And she really was very mean and she used to like pull students by the ears kind of [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.12,0:01:38.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it was like half abusive in some sense er..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.06,0:01:40.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So that was really bad and I really hated her
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.74,0:01:43.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But I did actually meet some friends who also went to her classes
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.16,0:01:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Who also like we kind of united around hating this particular teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.88,0:01:49.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we used to hang out and talk about that quite a lot
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.10,0:01:52.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So that's a, there was a bonus there at least <laughs> [L] Yeah <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.18,0:01:54.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. yeah, no, so..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.68,0:01:57.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah the school is really good and I enjoyed being there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.76,0:02:02.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Except for the class cause being with, that one class was really hell
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.64,0:02:05.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that class was very important, cause they actually needed for your exams
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.20,0:02:08.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So at the end of the first year I think of me being there
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.38,0:02:11.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] We had to give this mandatory presentation essentially like [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.70,0:02:14.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh.. in classical music theory
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.06,0:02:18.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I was very scared cause I was still fairly introverted back in this time
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.00,0:02:20.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I had to go in front of this teacher kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.32,0:02:24.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] In front of everyone and in front of this particular teacher who I was really afraid of uh [L] Oh god
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.32,0:02:26.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And so I practiced a lot and I made up slides
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.88,0:02:29.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then kind of prepared the presentation and stuff uh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.30,0:02:31.86,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um when the day came, I did give the presentation, I was fairly happy with it
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.86,0:02:34.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] People applauded, so I thought I did a good job
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.18,0:02:37.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But then after I was done, like the teacher really started ripping into my work
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.74,0:02:40.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Kind of she really started to dismantle everything I'd done
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.08,0:02:43.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then she's no this is wrong, this is bad, why did you say this [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.00,0:02:46.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that really impacted my self confidence in some sense [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.74,0:02:49.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I was still very sensitive at the time so
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.38,0:02:52.24,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I really didn't <laughs> know what to do kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.24,0:02:54.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I went home and I told my parents about this
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.70,0:02:57.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then we talked to the school about it, to see if we could do something
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.12,0:03:01.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause I really just can't deal with this teacher anymore, I can't have her for another two years
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.20,0:03:03.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so we talked about it with the school
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.58,0:03:06.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And they said no we can't really get rid of her, she's a very important person
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.52,0:03:09.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Kind of she's on a number of steering boards kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.78,0:03:12.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So she kind of gets away with what she wants in some sense
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.62,0:03:14.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um even though they had trouble with her before
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.90,0:03:17.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So the solution was essentially we came up with was
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.72,0:03:19.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Was unfortunately that I hate to kind of <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.72,0:03:21.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The school shared a lot of courses with the normal high school
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.72,0:03:25.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I could transfer into the normal high school kind of and complete my courses there [L] Hmm okay
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.72,0:03:29.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Which was unfortunate for me kind of cause I'd be, also be leaving behind these friends I met kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.40,0:03:33.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And stuff but at least like I got to avoid cause she was really just making my life miserable
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.30,0:03:36.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And my parents were also happy I went to a more technical school <laughs> [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.48,0:03:41.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] They won <laughs> [S] Yeah they won at the end <laughs> they always do
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.46,0:03:47.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh yeah but at the end of the day I did finally graduate from this more technical school kind of, I went to high school
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.68,0:03:51.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh after I'd been in high school, oh no not in high school, in college, sorry
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.20,0:03:55.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And after I'd been in college for a while, I did actually meet one of the friends I met at this music school
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.12,0:03:57.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um and then we all got together and met up all of them again
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.40,0:04:00.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Hmm [S] And they said they were actually playing in a band
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.12,0:04:03.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah okay cool cool, and we were talking about it and like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.08,0:04:06.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Hey don't you want to like join us and we can like play this? Like what, me?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.06,0:04:09.26,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <laughs> I was like surprised like what they still wanna play with me
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.26,0:04:11.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like after all this time, they remembered things <breath>
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.94,0:04:13.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or remember me at all, so um..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.94,0:04:18.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I said yeah we can try it out, so eventually like I joined as a vocalist kind of, cause I actually can sing
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.54,0:04:21.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Don't know if you knew <laughs> [L] Yeah, that's cool
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.06,0:04:23.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so I joined with them uh we played kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.70,0:04:29.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And eventually we arranged to have a concert for our like some friends, a couple of months down the line
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.20,0:04:32.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it was a really great experience, like just singing that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.06,0:04:34.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er what's it called, no a concert. It was really great. [L] Hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.94,0:04:38.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like I really felt free, I felt like I was liberated kind of, it was really cool [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.58,0:04:41.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] That's cool [S] And that's kind of yeah my experience with music
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.94,0:04:46.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the fact that I actually did sing in a band so <laughs> in the end
