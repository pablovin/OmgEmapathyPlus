Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.56,0:00:21.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And a couple weeks ago I was traveling to Zurich as a tourist and I..
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.44,0:00:28.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <inaudible> I found this really cheap flight, online, and lonely I booked it <inaudible> once, so that's not a problem but I..

Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.00,0:00:51.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it was a evening flight, pretty much the last flight of the day, it was at nine pm or nine thirty pm or something
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.00,0:00:56.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So maybe I just reached the airport two hours before the time.. Um.. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.18,0:01:02.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Also.. the weather was not that.. was a bit rainy, and a bit windy, so I thought maybe I just worried guessing something was wrong
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.38,0:01:10.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And.. And to my.. not to my surprise but probably to my plan, as soon I entered in the airport there was a huge queue for check-in
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.42,0:01:14.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Apparently all the flights.. flights before were delayed because of the bad weather there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.20,0:01:19.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And.. So.. The airport was like <inaudible> to people completely like..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.50,0:01:20.58,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] The check-in was full..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.58,0:01:21.48,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Locked-down
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.48,0:01:24.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Security was completely filled up and..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.74,0:01:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And kinda even more much in the whole thing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.42,0:01:27.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.22,0:01:33.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Somehow.. I barely managed to reach the board and get it before it closed, like five minutes before it closed
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.90,0:01:38.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Could running my bags through check-in to security and somehow making it through
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.54,0:01:44.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This guy was not happy with me, because I was kinda of just on time.. and Uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.16,0:01:48.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they just let me in but they were not that.. visibly weren't pleased with that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.12,0:01:53.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And you know.. Some of these flight where hasn't these bridge connections to the plane, so you have to go down and take the bus
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.48,0:01:53.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.98,0:01:57.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That's one of the most annoying things that I hate..
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.56,0:02:02.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because you.. I was just packed into the small bus looking a lot cheap and then taking you to somewhere and drop-out
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.82,0:02:07.64,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So we took the bus and as soon as we reached the airplane
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.64,0:02:13.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I see this really small propeller plane like the <inaudible> a really small one
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.08,0:02:11.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.52,0:02:18.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I hate the propeller plane because I'm always scared flying in them, I don't know why, it's just a bug
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.34,0:02:23.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I don't trust that plane so much.. I like the jet planes I think they are the most evolved of this ones
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.88,0:02:27.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the noise that they made when they flying is just scary for me
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.30,0:02:34.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then.. there wasn't much I could do right? I just boarded in the plane.. they were rushing us, I think they were delayed or something..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.27,0:02:39.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They were forcing us to get in there as soon as possible <inaudible> so they could take off
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.02,0:02:45.65,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They were a bit rude to be honest not that.. not that pleasant, just pushed us in and.. we settled on.. to the..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.65,0:02:50.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. my seat.. I settled to my seat and I just packed my self in..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.85,0:02:57.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then they announce that the traffic control was not that clear because of the bad weather and they might wait till the tower back
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.92,0:03:05.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Or sometime, I was like why in the hell are you are you pushing us into the bus if we have to seat here for another few minutes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.27,0:03:10.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Thus, we settled and waited the tarmac for one hour waiting for the flight take off
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.55,0:03:19.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And these guys aren't turning on the air conditioning so.. it was a crappy place for one hour almost no oxygen to breathe.. Uh.. I mean that was just..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.55,0:03:27.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Too annoying for me, small place.. I a little bit claustrophobic, I was just getting paranoic all the time but.. this flight I was getting done with it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.95,0:03:36.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. At least we did take off, not the smoother, but we took off, I think that was a really strong wind, we were just like drifting along side, just shaky
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.72,0:03:41.05,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. Somehow we reached the cruiser altitude.. Um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.05,0:03:47.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I thought I could remove the seat belt maybe go to the restroom, but they didn't switch of the seat belt sign
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.10,0:03:52.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the lavatory was not allowed to be used because there was too much turbulence the plance was going from left to right and they said.. well..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.72,0:03:58.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] You can't move you should be back to your seat.. Uh.. people were having issues, because they weren't using the restroom or something..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.95,0:04:01.65,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] There were no services no water, nothing was served in the flight
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.65,0:04:04.97,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] And you were sitting there for one hour,..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.97,0:04:12.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, exactly I mean, they should give something, right? A bag of peanuts at least I guess or some free cold drink or something, nothing it's just weird
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.40,0:04:09.27,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Yeah.. Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.67,0:04:17.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then things get even worst, suddenly the lights go off, of the plane
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.22,0:04:24.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we see lighting outside, so these flashes of light was coming in like a horror movie, you watching a scene from a horror movie
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.35,0:04:22.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.45,0:04:28.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Completely dark and Uh.. flight with lights coming from outside
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.60,0:04:33.17,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I feel like something is falling, sometimes in these turbulences the plane com up and down
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.72,0:04:33.15,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.15,0:04:41.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I feel this fall, and it's not like this instant one second two seconds things, it's like fifteen twenty seconds of constant fall it's like the plane drop four hundred feets or something
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.70,0:04:49.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I panicking at this point of time because this is something my worst nightmare are made of, like planes crashing and things like that..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.97,0:04:48.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.97,0:04:55.77,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. And to my horror after some few seconds of this dropping the oxygen masks drop off
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.77,0:05:04.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I've never had this experience before in my life, I've never used this things, and I got.. I mean we all see the guy telling us about it, but you never think this gonna happen
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.85,0:05:04.57,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.57,0:05:10.85,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I can't put it on, the guy next to me kinda of.. helped me to put this on to my.. so I could breathe again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.85,0:05:18.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we had to go to this harrowing experience of these oxygen masks and jumping up and down for the next twenty minutes or so of the flight
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.40,0:05:26.55,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the flight will go up for few seconds and then suddenly it will drop and few go up and then suddenly it will drop and this continued for the next twenty, thirty minutes
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.55,0:05:34.67,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Finally I think we were getting close of our destination and we were reaching to Zurich, the flight kinda of stabilized a bit, the weather cleared.. Um..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.67,0:05:43.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And then we are.. we could remove our masks, lights came back on again, we could use the lavatories, and by the time <inaudible> so shaky and annoyed with the whole experience that I didn't want to do anything
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.80,0:05:44.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.20,0:05:45.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And this landed..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.55,0:05:51.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Even the landing for the matter was not that smooth we bumped around the airrun twice before we actually landed down
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.82,0:05:56.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So, one of the worst worst experiences in my life.. Uh..
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.20,0:06:00.37,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As soon as I got in the airport I canceled my flight of the way back
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.37,0:06:04.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And booked my train, so I could back by train, I didn't want to the same experience again
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.60,0:06:07.22,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because it probably would be the same flight in the way back
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.22,0:06:12.45,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I don't think I can travel back in these propeller plane flights again
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.45,0:06:16.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Specially in the night so.. I gonna make sure that I'm taking the flight timing and I..
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.72,0:06:20.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I pretty sure about that's not a propeller plane, it's a big plane that..
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.70,0:06:26.32,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I'm flying on and never have this experience again, I hope it doesn't happen to the big planes
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.32,0:06:29.95,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But this was one of the worsts things that I had to come through in my life
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.95,0:06:31.95,Default,,0,0,0,,
