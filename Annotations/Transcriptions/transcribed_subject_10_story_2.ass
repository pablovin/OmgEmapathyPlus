Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.36,0:00:15.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I started to look for kind of a way of filling the gap in some sense
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.02,0:00:20.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Kinda feeling that.. kind of acting out so to speak like <laughs> [L] Okay <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.52,0:00:24.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um.. I started to get really interested in music, and kind of becoming a musician 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.68,0:00:29.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I thought it would be a really, well I need to just vent kind of, some emotions I had piled up [L] Yeah

Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.22,0:00:45.36,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] They treated it more as a kind of passing phase
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.36,0:00:48.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Kind of that they hoped would go over so <laughs> [L] Okay <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.60,0:00:52.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er it was.. not that seriously no [L] They didn't take you seriously

Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.34,0:01:00.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that went on for a while, the closest I could get to kind of convincing them of anything
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.10,0:01:03.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Is that once I was going to transfer from middle school to high school
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.82,0:01:07.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I convinced them to let me go to a more like musically oriented high school
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.60,0:01:11.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] As long as the high school had like proper subjects like maths and chemistry <laughs> [L] Okay.. ah, okay <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.88,0:01:13.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So not just music um.. [L] Yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.88,0:01:16.42,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So they agreed to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.42,0:01:18.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the school was very nice actually ah.. [L] Okay, that's nice.. uh-huh

Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.60,0:01:31.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that, er I had a really great time there, I <inaudible>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.88,0:01:36.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Except it lasted for a while at least, there was one thing that I had, I really had a problem with [L] Uh-huh.. uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.74,0:01:41.50,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And that was there's this one mandatory course we had to take, which was classical music theory [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.50,0:01:44.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And the big issue with that course was that there was this teacher
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.38,0:01:48.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I'm pretty sure that she was some kind of demon in the shape of a human being kind of <laughs> [L] <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.34,0:01:51.18,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Because she was really just an awful person kind of <laughs> [L] Shit
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.18,0:01:52.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Oh my god [S] She would like er
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.94,0:01:56.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She would yell at students and drag students around by the ear kind of [L] Oh shit
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.14,0:01:59.20,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] What the hell [S] If they were misbehaving.. yeah she was not stable
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.20,0:02:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Okay.. wow [S] <laughs> ah..
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.00,0:02:04.74,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So being the, being in class with this woman was terrifying
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.74,0:02:07.90,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And it really like scared me kind of to have to go to her course
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.90,0:02:11.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause everything else was fine, but this is [L] This teacher was a problem
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.12,0:02:13.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] This teacher was a major problem essentially [L] Okay.. uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.62,0:02:15.62,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I did actually make friends off of those, strangely enough
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.62,0:02:19.14,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause like, there were these other four guys in the class, who went to the same class weirdly [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.14,0:02:24.56,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And we actually bond over hating this teacher <laughs> like after the classes [L] Okay <laughs> yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.56,0:02:29.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Difficult and angry all the time and yeah.. [L] <inaudible> uh-huh.. okay
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.06,0:02:32.40,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah so, it went okay like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.40,0:02:36.96,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Cause she made my life really miserable with the classes but the rest of the school stuff was kind of okay [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.96,0:02:40.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She did have other courses but those were taken the two later years kind of [L] Okay, that's nice.. okay
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.82,0:02:45.66,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Er.. everything was kind of fine for the first year kind of [L] Uh-huh.. hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.66,0:02:51.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Eventually we got to this point where we had to give this big presentation in classical music theory in front of the entire class [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.30,0:02:54.28,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was still fairly shy and fragile at that point in time
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.28,0:02:58.30,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it was difficult, so this was a scary enough prospect, of just presenting in front of the entire class for me [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.30,0:03:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] It was a bit spooky [L] How many students were there?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.00,0:03:06.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah there were about.. 20 something I think so [L] Okay, uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.16,0:03:09.76,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah it was till a sizable crowd for someone so young tho [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.76,0:03:15.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] To present in front of, you know like talking in front of 8 people is a bit errifying like <laughs> [L] Okay.. yeah.. yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.92,0:03:18.68,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah.. so partially I was scared of presenting in front of the class
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.68,0:03:22.98,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But also I had to present for this teacher who I'm fairly sure was very unhinged kind of [L] Ah yes, it's awful
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.98,0:03:25.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Not a happy person essentially [L] Yeah <laughs> okay
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.46,0:03:27.88,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it took me kind of, I prepared a lot for this kind of [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.88,0:03:30.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I was very nervous, I prepared a lot, I prepared slides [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.60,0:03:34.54,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I really rehearsed in front of a mirror kind of, to make sure it would be good um [L] Okay.. uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.54,0:03:38.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Eventually the day came, I gave the presentation, I was fairly happy with it [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.60,0:03:42.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Like people clapped and the they laughed in between the presentation, that was nice [L] Ah that's nice
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.72,0:03:47.70,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah but then the teacher started to give feedback and she really like ripped into my what's it called um..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.70,0:03:51.80,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Presentation. So she really said like no this is wrong, this is awful, why you do this kind of [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.80,0:03:54.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] <inaudible> and why did you say, should've spoken louder kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.46,0:03:57.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] Okay.. uh-huh [S] And really just like mean spirited uh feedback
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.82,0:03:59.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Not really constructive at all [L] Okay 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.82,0:04:02.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I had a very tough time handling this kind of ah..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.82,0:04:06.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I had a very fragile self esteem at that point in time so I was <breath> [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.84,0:04:10.34,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Difficult for me to parse the information, I suppose
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.34,0:04:13.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So it's like difficult for me to kind of absorb that [L] Yeah, of course, uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.60,0:04:17.94,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So essentially.. I did kind of just go home to my parents in tears
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.94,0:04:21.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And I like to tell them like this isn't gonna work, I can't deal with this
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.08,0:04:23.08,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Ah we had to go and talk with the school
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.08,0:04:25.78,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] But they said like, no we can't really get rid of her kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.78,0:04:29.72,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] She's on a number of boards, like she's essentially there to stay is what they kind of said [L] Oh my god 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.72,0:04:34.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[L] So you couldn't do anything about it either [S] No she was a, she was a permanent fixture unfortunately
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.84,0:04:38.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So there was scarcely more we could do, but she also held a bunch of other courses essentially, which was a problem [L] Ah shit, uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.84,0:04:42.38,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh so we discussed with them and we eventually came to a solution [L] Uh-huh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.38,0:04:46.84,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] That we could transfer me to kind of, there's a high school which shared a number of courses with this
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.84,0:04:49.60,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Uh.. music oriented school, and we [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.60,0:04:54.16,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Took to that we could transfer in to me into this normal school program essentially [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.16,0:05:00.46,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] And so continue my education, so I could avoid these mandatory music courses that were required from and held by this teacher [L] Uh-huh.. ah okay
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.46,0:05:04.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so.. [L] Yeah but that means you losing studying music
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.92,0:05:08.92,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Yeah, it was not great, but she made my life singularly miserable
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.92,0:05:12.12,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] I kind of thought, what's it called, I can get back into it later [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.12,0:05:17.82,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] My parents thought yeah he's going to study IT stuff, I was like that's fine as well right? <laughs> [L] Yes <laughs>
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.82,0:05:22.10,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] Um so that's kind of, kind of what happened to me in essence [L] Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.10,0:05:26.52,Default,,0,0,0,,[S] So I transferred and then finished a normal like more traditional thing, I did kind of put [L] More traditional school and not
